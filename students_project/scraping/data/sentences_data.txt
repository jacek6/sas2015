it would be the best device ever made if the battery was 5000mAh
i bought an external battery from amazon  and i have now double the battery life
it has a mali400mp4 (quad core gpu) it gives you the same graphics as the galaxy note 2
and never forget to buy a 32 gig micro sd card	3
I was able to look over this and even the terrible battery life	3
the screen resolution and clarity is great	9
much brighter and more colorful than iphone	9
The only stupid thing is the battery door :/ what crap to open	8
The display is excellent	9
This phone have a really nice battery for nowadays avarage	10
and a reasonable display	8
Also the CPU is very fast for it's class and can compete against most low-mid end phones!
The phone is very good for gaming	9
Also the camera is great	8
The stock camera app is poor	10
i have installed LG Camera and now it the pictures are verry good	10
with nice IPS display wich is clearly visible even on sunlight	10
1) Camera is only 3	5
but to my surprise the effect of the photo is clear	5
4) Battery run pretty fast	6
the battery life is awesome and its very powerful machine	10
The screen is really nice	10
The battery life is great: with 8 months of active usage	10
the battery has yet to die on me (and I have had to spend a few days without a charger here and there)	10
The camera is pretty nice (8MP on a tablet is really nice)	10
my only complaint is the "glass" of the display which has a plasticky feel to it	10
superb display	10
amazing battery life	10
Display Is One Of Those Huge Upgrades	10
And The Camera Is Nothing To Write Home About Plus It Lacks Flash	8
Overall Its screen is identical to the one we know from its predecessor - a 9	10
7-inch Retina Display with oleophobic coating and resolution of 1536 by 2048 pixels	10
with iPhoto	8
The screen is just as the same as ipad 4	5
Battery life is among the best out there	8
5mp camera sucks though I don't use too often	5
keeping in mind that other have a quad core processor and hell a lot higher frequency	10
4 Ghz processor	10
I think the only other company can design processors as good as apples' is intel	10
The stunning Retina display sits inside thinner bezels	10
And they come in a whole range of colors	10
its unreal how the quality of this device is its camera is the best of the best it has an a7
64 bit proceccor and its thin as a pencil and it feels like you are holding nothing its so light if you dont want it to brake then dont be clumsy and stupid and hold it everywhere you go for no reason	10
Speedy	10
adding stronger processor and a few new features	9
A beautiful Retina display	9
64-bit desktop-class processor	9
If Touch ID is present and the camera has been improved	5
specially in retina display	10
battery life 11-12 hours	10
runs fast and display HD resolution	10
But the front camera is not that clear	9
The battery also drains faster than the first generation	9
The Retina Display Are Any New For The iPad Mini	10
The Battery Are So Good	10
but still want a display that is large and clear enough to get work done	9
The battery life is excellent	10
I get 9-13 hours with screen brightness about a quarter to half way up	9
The display is very clear	9
but the colors aren't as accurate as an iPhone screen	9
The camera is decent if you have nothing else to shoot with	8
but is nothing compared to an iPhone or a real camera	8
the screen will shatter	9
It has a powerful processor	9
great display	9
great battery life	10
decent camera and speakers	8
- Unibody construction
- Display has a very high colour accuracy
- Best tablet in the market	10
the iPhone 5c would be pretty good if it had a bigger display	7
It is fast and has a pretty good camera	8
Phone battery dies after a couple of hours	1
Camera is poor too	6
poor battery	5
Dropped it from 40cm and got a small crack but display very good 4 inch	8
And one more thing is the camera	7
Color was cool too	10
Battery last longer 'til 4 days without using net	10
HD screen	10
I love the display	9
the speed	10
the camera	9
I'm not a huge fan of the camera (the quality is good for what kind of phone it is	9
This phone's display and quality is OK for a low-budget phone	10
Battery performance is also good	8
Awesome Mobile it have nice features everything is good in this phone and of course as it's an iphone must be good quality and premium only the battery is yhe proplem but overall it's one of the best phones i have ever tried i have the white 16gb version i bought it from 2 weeks and everything is excellant	10

most of us have it in an otterbox runs just as fast if not faster as my old 5 but with a better battery	9
on a bigger screen	8
In the colour choice of the phone	8
And in the various colour choices in the cases	8
But it will be enjoyable to gradually save and buy different colours	8
The iphone 5c also has the internationally reputable camera that the iPhones have been known to have	10
However the battery isn't the greatest	7
otherwise I don't know why he is complaining about screen size	10
and it is just as large as most mid sized phone screens	10
The resolution and ppi are excellent	10
giving it a good screen	10
and good colour replication as well as brightness and contrast	10
The processor is solid	9
apple just has great fluency in the display area	10
i love the colors and the plastic case	9
great screen size	9
Iphone 5c is colourful and it currently running on ios 7	10
photos	9
if you have a large music or photo library or you frequently download HD movies	9
If you have a relatively small music or photo library or rarely make or buy movies	9
better photos	10
The increase in screen size (minimal by a persnickety user)is welcome	9
some apps have a tendency to drain the battery	7
Although the screen on the phone might seem small when compared to other flagship Android phones it's plenty enough and this small negative is offset by the fact that you have that 10" tablet screen lying around	10
The extended battery makes the device last for a full day through even most abusive days and it lasts easily for days when not in heavy use	10

3MP camera with flash	3
a 820mAh battery	7
and an SD card slot which is essential for using the music player or camera given the miniscule internal memory	3
The screen is big	9
The battery seems to last a few days with light use	7

I do like the color scheme	9
and a photo viewer	3
I also don't like that it lacks volume buttons or a quick camera button	3
the SD card slot is under the battery and is a bit tricky to change the card even with steady hands	7
Five Words: Best cheap phone to date!
Love the display	10
Its not a rugged phone but it goes the distance on battery time	10
Delivers what it promises and has a spectacular screen	10
It has a fast dual core processor	7
one of the brightest displays on the market	10
8mp camera	8
Battery life is weak	6
the screen shows some strange lines that are not good	5
I changed the screen and disappear	5
Battery life on the phone is excellent	10
The back camera has got to be the least desirable feature	3
There is no dedicated camera button	3
and sometimes the flash will lag after the screen is pressed	9
Except the battery longevity	10

Was constantly taking screenshots when I would lock the phone	9
Camera does not zoom	4
I hated it due to I had nails and could not work the touch screen	8
The day after I got it I realized the battery quality was inadequate for my usage	2
the battery life is pretty good	8
The camera takes really bad pictures inside	5
and the screen is not as clear as other smart phones	7
i got this phone as  a gift from my grandparents at 1st i really hate coming from a wp7 and a touch screen	10
who spending most of my time listening to music
camera has fixed focus	8

messaging interface is quite boring but thankfully bb app market offer tons of messeging enhancement (im using the crunchsms and it was impressive!!)
nfc is also is a great addition interacting with others would not put you to shame ;)
if there is one thing that really frustrates me that would be the battery it last almost a day but with heavy use it last only for about 6-8hrs of nonstop wifi  listening to music and bbm
overall if your up to blackberry and you dont want to spend that much without risking the premium feel well i highly recommend this phone	6
No problems with reception or wifi though being an old phone doesn't support the latest high speed networks	6
Instead of a fragile touchscreen it has a smooth infrared trackpad thing to move a cursor	6
Battery life is mediocre; so it is a good idea to enable the battery saving feature and turn off bluetooth	5
The camera shutter sound is loud and can't be disabled	4
The camera has a flash	4

well what can i say this phone is great the battery life is great	10
HSDPA speeds are off the charts	9
battery lasts easily a day of heavy usage or two of moderate	9
It may not have the best processor out there	9
The camera is good but nothing special	8
No more worries about battery making through a day	9
Battery life is wonderful and the features are very good and seriously i'll recommend this one to others	10
all on a large 5" touchscreen slab	5
The Z30 sports a 2800 mAh massive battery that can easily last a full day even under heavy usage (a rarity in the modern smartphone universe)	10
the typing experience is something else and rivals the speed at which users can	10

It may not have the fastest processor out there	10
(will make sense to you if you have a BB10 device)
no lag -Played graphic intensive games without issues increased dual core CPU and quad core GPU help in this regard	10
APK installs/lock screen actionable notifications/quick settings etc of 10	9
1
Z30 cons:
-Not enough customization (lockscreen/OS/settings) - on Android you can switch it up to just about anything you wish	9
-camera subpar	9

Apple iPhone 5S - Screen is just "too small for serious consideration"
Galaxy S4 - I had an S3 found the software to be buggy and the screen was horrible to type on - S4 did not seem "different enough" to me	10
- Touchscreen Keyboard - BEST on Market	10
- 25 hour battery life - lasts 2 full days on one charge - easily
- 6 speaker "Natural Sound System" - Best on Any Smartphone for listening to music	10

- Camera - more than sufficient - may be a better one out there - never an issue
- 1080 HD video recording	9
if you are looking for a phone with an amazing 5 inch screen - you should consider this phone as an Android alternative	10
how many milion pixels are on my screen or how many fanboys the brand has	9
One of the things i do not understand is why "System" suddenly starts using more and more battery until it completely drains it	2
what actual program in SYSTEM decided to use my phone's battery without asking for my permission because maybe i will not agree for my phone to be locked to my wall socket 24/7 because the battery will instantly drain whenever it is unplugged	2

open up in the homescreen randomly	9
browsing speed and build quality is impressive	10
A high speed buffer jamming it between the spinning pad and the frame was what it took to take it out	8
This phone has decent speed	8
The camera quality isn't so hot though	5
Battery life (although it has a bulky upgrade option)

when I switched from Sprint to Verizon I was interested in the Casio G'zOne Commando but the data speed would have been too slow for when I needed	9
The Commando 4G provides great data speeds	9
your lock screen is a compass)	8
My only real complaint about the phone in the battery like	7
The battery on average will get me through the day but just barely	7
If I start using the phone too heavily the battery drains very very quickly	7
I am looking into getting either an extended battery for the phone or some kind of external battery	7

5 days worth of battery	8
Camera isn't amazing	6
the camera is slow (no "in the moment" pictures)	2
so I have no problem at all with the "speed" of the phone	8
I can say with confidence that the speed of this phone is plenty fast enough for the average person	8
The battery is disappointing	6
and I still have 25% battery life left - this is 10 hours and 41 minutes since I pulled it from the charger this morning	6
camera	10
display and all the extras	10
The battery is just like all smartphone batteries	8
My battery last 2 days with texting	8
The battery life in this phone is terrible which was another point why i would want to bring it back to verizon	3
It cannot run multiple apps (2-3 background app's) without the battery on the phone being completely drained in a matter of five to six hours from full charge	3
But if they revamped this phone and did a major upgrade in speed and other area's i'd have no problem coming back to this phone	6
I have to charge the battery everyday and I am not a heavy user	1
1 photo sent 5 or 6 text	6
Once you notice the alarms are not working you have to remove the battery and re-insert it for the alarms to work again	1
You have to remove the battery and reinsert it to get the phone to work again	1
I remember my Rock having a simplified front touch screen to scroll through the Gz gear and music or I could use the motion detection to do music	6
and the screen is either blank	1
CAMERA IS CRAPPY IN EVERYTHING BUT SUNLIGHT & HAS NO ZOOM	2
the camera on the txtm8 3g sucks you need light and it still isnt that good with recording either	4
It has exceptional battery which lasts for 2-3 days with 3-4 hours of 3g usage	10
super amoled screen	8
Camera quality is very good	9
a Galaxy Nexus and I ultimately left the droid scene because of the nexus battery life and have used an iphone from 4-6) I had originally wanted the Nexus 5 but it was not offered on verizon so i lucked out with this model	10
Battery life runs circles around my iphone and any other phone I have ever used	10
I managed to get 28 hours of battery life with moderate-heavy usage	10
Data speed and reception is nothing to complain about	9
Camera can be slow at times which is annoying but the quality is amazing (everyone with iphones	8

Good: Great camera for a phone this price; Being uncannily light for its size makes it feel more like you're holding the software itself rather than the hardware	9
Neutral: The display is decent	8
not a standout feature by any means; Battery seems okay; Overall build-quality is fine for the price	8
"
Evil: Not as quick as other (albeit more expensive) devices out there; I feel like LG and Google are mocking me by putting two speakers on the front yet not including stereo sound; The screen is offset just a hair towards the top of the device	8
The camera is amazing especially in low light	10
the display is great	10
People often talk about the battery life being sub par	9
And I can't stress enough that this camera is amazing	10
The battery capacity is amazing	10
and the screen density is very sharp and clear	10
I loved the bright colors on the screen	9
I sacrifice a little bit of screen size on with the Nexus	9
Note that I had the extended battery installed on my Evo though	9
but I'll get into battery life in a second	9
Battery life is much	9
My Nexus gets the same battery life as my Evo did with it's extended battery	9
Battery life indicator	9
The screen is amazingly bright and crisp	10
The processor is very fast	9
and do a battery pull once a week or so	7
I get a full day out of the battery with moderate use	7
but the display tends to suck the life out of it if I watch videos or spend much time online	10
Since the screen is 4	10
The camera is probably the biggest disappointment	6

The battery life is much better on the Nexus compared to the Evo	9
I was extremely surprised to find that utilizing the 4G network during my drives to stream things like podcasts or Pandora did not show significantly more battery drain	9
Quicker than the EVO with better battery life	8
Tough to gage the battery since the phone is new to me and im constantly playing with it but im barley getting a full day with it	8
For instance I was getting a call and when i went to look at the screen to see who was calling it stayed black not allowing me to see anything until i hit the power button	9
I do miss the hdmi output for Netflix (Evo phone was rooted and app to mimic the screen) to be able to watch on any hmdi TV	10
the back cover tends to get smudgy and the camera could have been better	7
the battery lasts through the day if not longer	8
the screen is amazing	10
The only issues i've found is that I tend to get a pinkish haze in the middle of some photos  in certain lighting conditions	7
no 720p video recording and the glass screen isnt Gorilla Glass	8
good camera quality	10
great battery life and have great design (light weight)	10
The display is the best	9
Decent Battery Life (better than lot of HTC Phones)	8
Great Touch Screen Sensitivity	9
Sharp Screen with very Bright Colors (Overall screen result is far better than lot of HTC Phones)
Cons: Call Quality could be better	9
No zoom camera	7
and cons is battery	7
but i know that all smartphones have sample battery for example my brother have samsung galaxy s2	7
and it has the same battery life	7
Some people do not like nexus`s camera (or need camera button)	9
getting the newest OTA updates (including ICS :D) and being able to have a sexy curved glass screen	10
it is lightening fast and the screen is better than a home LCD tv	10
color is vibrant and the screen is awsome	10
Hi use this phone all is good but have two problems the wifi reception sometime very poor reception and second the battery problem cannot charge full charge 100% only stay in 94% i dont know what happen maybe google need to resolve this problem	3
The new phone comes with the first 4” contour display screen	10
the screen is clear and sharp	10
I love the screen	10
battery is not too bad (almost same with my wife's Iphone 4 in both battery and responsiveness wise)	10
I heard that Samsung makes the screens for iPhone anyway	10
My nexus s screen is significantly brighter than my epic 4g	10
So the screen has been improved	10
screen is so vibrant and glass is smooth as silk! :) (btw I did the scratch test with my keys	10
This is such a small screen that I can't even read anything instead it is too pixelized too	2
and camera is very limited	1
I loved the phones features but its not worth a purchase due to poor battery life	2
Pros:
• 4G speeds which I never/cant be used based on my location in WI	10
• The cameras are superb front and rear	8
(Pointless)
• Excellent speed memory capabilities handles apps and browsing with mere ease	10
This device has the poorest battery life I have ever gotten from any android device in my entire electronic collection	2
The phone has to be experienced to understand the magnitude of frustration and anger that the battery can cause	2
Constantly on the charger pointless to be a mobile device for VERY short times of battery	2
If you love battery life	2
Its screen is pretty good especially in the dark	10
camera quality is extremley nice and i enjoyed the video quality as well	9
Battery life isnt the best but its still ok to me (If u put it in airplane mode when not using data its battery life dramatically improves)	8
it has a brillant screen in 2d and 3d that's second to none at the moment	10
I think that the biggest turn off was the screen	5
the colors were dull and the screen wasn't bright at all	5
its really fast great big display and its perfect	10
3 inch screen	10
the camera quality is great	10
The 3D camera is something that is just so cool	7
I've had this phone for about a month now and I love it! The battery life is amazing	10
It lasts through the whole day with me and if you're not a heavy phone user the battery only needs to be charged every 2-3 days	10
I ran out into the street and got there just in time to see a BUS RUN OVER IT!!! put the battery back in	8
and have gone through 1 due to accidentally busting my screen	10
not to mention GREAT battery life	3
well that phone was a disaster!!! HTC EVO is a well built phone! 2 year's passed and it is still one of the most competitive phones out there! Great display! Great multitasking! I am running 3 languages on this phone - English	10
and German! Face detection as your screen lock! Sick - no other phone for VM got it	10
or am I wrong? I got no clue what you could be doing all day to drain the battery! I am an undergrad and use my phone in am to play music on my way to uni	9
Skype my parents abroad and my battery lasts me till about 5 pm when I plug it in the car	9
So don't run your display on full brightness and you will be fine! Never lagged! If you can't get service	10
You can run most games on this device! Although the camera is only 5MP	8

A solution to short battery life is to buy a third party battery (i use a 1900 mah anker battery) which lasts 2 to 3 hours longer than the stock battery on average	5
The camera has a considerable amount of shutter lag	5
1 stock camera app works best (compared to the htc sense camera and 4	5
2 stock camera)	5
Its got a decent processor	5
but by no means a speed demon	5
3D is mostly a gimmick as there is only a little content that actually takes advantage of the screen	8
The thing about using the 3D is that it drains the battery	9
but I assume using the 3D will take a portion of your battery	9
The cameras are great	9
the dedicated camera button and 3D toggle was a good feature to add	9
and the screen quality is great for it being a qHD display	10
I so wiah that there were more notification light colors like blue because I'm color-blind and when I see my notification light i can't tell if it is red or yellow or green	10
battery life was poor	3
4" qHD 3D display	9
2 Ghz Snapdragon cpu pushing Android 4	10
The display is very crisp and bright	9
Has a 5 MP dual camera with flash and front facing 1	9
The only downfall is the battery	6

I think the camera could be so much better for Regular Pics i forget i even have 3D	8
a phone with a longer battery life	8
Today i went to sprint and orderd my Motorola PHOTON 4G	2
The next day when my battery ran out after 5 or so hours and shut down	1
told me to go by a Motorola Photon	1
I was told that even though the Photon was only a week old	1
I traded my EVO 3D in for the Photon and have been happy every since	1
Battery easily lasts all day which is more than I can say for my iphone	10
LOVE THE PHONE!
MY BATTERY SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN STRONGER AFTER 4 TH CHARGE	10
TOOK A LITTLE GETTING USED TO FOR VIEWING 3D PICS BUT WHEN THE SCREEN CLEARS OUT THE PICS COME ALIVE	10
Its so cool and the 3D camera is actually quite functional	10
2 ghz processor	10
The battery is okay but its still pretty good	7
This year they set it way up there! Of course the 3D display is amazing	10
Screen quality is supurb vs	10
Speed wise it's head and shoulders about it's older brother	10
2 ghz processor makes	10
Jury's still out on the increased capacity battery	9
The thing that stunned me the most is the battery I can get through a whole day with normal use (yes this includes downloading apps and looking stuff up on the internet)	10
3D camera is actually cool	10
Display is gorgeous	10
Same with the battery	10
able to actually enjoy the phone without having to worry about the battery life	10
2 processor	10
better battery	10
HD display	10
awesome camera	10
BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW!!! SV-DO integrated (talk & surf on 3G!!!!) fast cpu (1	10
the white color is beautiful!!!!	10
Display	10
camera	8
Only downside is the non removable battery	6
Camera takes exellent photos	10
easily outdoing its rivals in color reproduction	10
and I think of the Evo as if the One X and One S got together and had a kid: it combines the One X's beautiful screen with the One S' aluminum-unibody-with-polycarbonate-inserts	10
the new Evo combines the best of both its predecessors: the kickstand from the 4G and the camera button from the 3D	9
while being extremely fluid and snappy (rivaling the UI speed of the iPhone)	8

" you definitely get what you pay for: 3G speeds are sub-par	8
by virtue of its blazing speed	8
beautiful screen	10
battery life is terrible and i dont even surf the net that much	2
I would say very good battery life because we were good for leaving it unplugged	10
like the first one that appears saying the camera is horrible but yet all my photos that i take with this phone look proffessional and i just point and shoot thats the point of the dedicated camera button	10
I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with the camera which had such rave reviews	1
it just appears that the camera is what it is	1
and that is the worst camera I've used since disposables	1
I went on a trip shortly after getting the camera and didn't take another camera along because this camera was so raved about	1
The colors were extremely disappointing and the vast majority are really grainy and out of focus	10
I spent a great deal of time experimenting with settings and using the highest resolution settings	10
is that this is not a point and shoot camera	1
there a lot of options on this phone's camera which can be interesting but it takes a lot of setting to get set up for each shot	1
which is a major downside to this camera	1

good phone for cost and really good camera	10
battery is better than any other evo's in the past and i have had them all	9
in Houston (where I reside) the internet was going to be fast (at 4g speeds)	10
I bought it for a trial period and I only noticed it got strong 3g speeds and when I'm at work	10
my only CON is that the battery life is very low	3
the battery dies anyway (and I don't even have any open apps)	3
the screen is really big & typing was not a problem	10
The one thing I miss about this phone is that it was so conviniently customized on each screen	10

I was thinking evo or s3 i have the evo and my first worry was the battery i will tell you my battery gives me 24 hours like right now my son is play games has  two hours already and we have about 85%	10
the camera really good even better than my old evo	10
great camera	10
If HTC just would have given it a dual core CPU	8
a better 8MP camera and a bit more internal memory	5
The camera could use some help	5
crisp 4" screen is great for every day use	10
its cheap and sprints coverage in my area is 3G with speeds 10 times faster then Tmo's 2G	9
The phone itself has a beautiful screen	10
The battery life is one of the biggest areas of concern	7

The phone itself has a beautiful screen	10
The battery life is one of the biggest areas of concern	7
I am looking into an extended battery	7
all reasonable videos for the screen size work fine	10
The battery lasts my entire day but needs charging when I get home	8
The screen is high quality for a 4 inch display	9
4G speeds	8
and for a single core device there are no complaints with the speed at all	8
The screen is not as big and vivid like am already used to	8
i noticed that the battery kept getting hot on the back	2
the front of the screen was caving in on the sides	8
And i also heard at best buy that this phone's battery got so hot it exploded in someones hand	2
2 Ghz processor is adequate	9
The Display is amazing	10
and the media player is fantastic; but the battery doesn't last long enough to really enjoy it all	5
The screen is absolutely not scratch resistant	1
She scratched her screen left and right	1
because the HTC Sense launcher has to reload every time you go to the home screen and its extremely basic	1
and i have never had battery life anywhere near the ones reported in the specs	1
bright screen unlike the Intercept & a better display	10
I also thought that the battery life would be longer	6
and the slide out keyboard NEVER lags the screen upon opening	10
this phone is instant! The battery lasts 24 hours if I use the phone constantly to play games and use apps	10
it's camera sucks	7
The speed is okay to use	10
camera is awesome and we enlarged one picture in full size but no pixels were destroyed	10
processor is slow does'nt matter but works very fast	10
it has a great display and is a handy size	9
However the battery is the worst one I have ever had	1
However it eats up so much battery that it will completely run out of charge after a day even if its only ever been on stand by	1
After 3 month of this happening about 7 times- the battery completely died	1
I am trying to find a new battery for it as I really like the phone	1
screen Display problem	3
3mp camera is o	9
battery life is goood as i expected!!!!	10
display is good	9
camera can be little better	8
even battery support in smart mode in gud	9
internet speed is fast	9
display is good	10
battery is also ok	9
battery life poor	7
The internet browser is better than my iPod touch's and it supports flash!  The screen is a little cramped for typing but it doesn't matter because I can type so quickly due to the predictive text engine being so accurate	10
Screen is very responsive and aluminum body makes it feel indestructible I wish felt a little heavier in my hand	10
Camera takes surprisingly nice photos also for a point and shoot	9
but remember it's still a phone camera	9
like you cant install all games on it because most games work slow cuzz of it's CPU	8
the display is very god	9
The phone uses very low speeds for its processor and ram but for general use like	5
camera	10
I still walk around with this phone for the camera but not only for the camera	10
Despite the previous reviews the battery take forever to recharge	6
7inc display and many more features	9
The text input is a little difficult at the beginning cause of the small screen but at the end you will get it	5
And the battery will last at much 1 and a half day	7
7" SLCD2 screen with 480x800 pixels of resolution	8
1GHz single-core processor	7
together with the 5MP camera on the back place it at the entry level of the new One lineup from HTC	9
which allows for all the good camera stuff in the new One line	9
The screen is very clear and text appears crisp and colors vivid	9
but it isn't close to the iPhone 4S retina display	9
When it comes to the camera - it's absolutely poop	6
it opens a weather widget to the lock screen	9
The main advantages of the phone against its competitors in class are its screen	9
with it you get a Single core 1 GHz processor	8
7 inch display by 480x800	8
You also get a 5 MP camera	7
In terms of battery life	9
along with the fast processor	8
7inc display	8
Camera effects and features	6
battery isn't that good	5
Camera is quite decent but not up the expectation (having noice in images)	6
this is the best phone really best display best design best build quality best internet and with the jelly bean this monster will be more awesome	10
Best display ever	10
true colors	10
Battery life is improved	10

I wanted Music Camera and Calling and everything is 10 star on this phone	10
has great internet speed	10

Sense offers a great variety of customization options such as the ability to customize the lock screen	10
I love how the phone shows you the weather throughout the home and lockscreen depending on what you choose	10
its a very nice feature that I always show off to my friends and family :)
The Display of this phone is just simply beautiful	10
The colors and detail are just incredible	10
it completely beats the displays of the Iphone 4s and the Galaxy S3 by far	10
I am also very pleased with the camera	10
which provides very detailed beautiful looking photos	10
HTC really lets you edit photos	10
When I first got the phone I wasn't very fond of the battery life	10

beautiful screen	10
and battery life is amazing (even in an LTE city)	10
phone has bad battery life	5
not enough settings for camera	10
The only bad thing is the battery	8
Another issue that folks tend focus on is battery life and I can tell you now that this will remain an issue unless someone invents a new form of battery technology	10
Motorola Razr phones and iOS devices have similar battery challenges	10

take photos and videos of my kids	10
Display in direct sunlight was my only Con	9
life battery is the worst I used in my life
But the phone is awesone it can perform any work easily	4
that it can render 1080p @ 60fps 24mbps from my digital camera	9
Camera is fine	9
looks like a normal digital camera	9
But the worst lack is the battery	7
It takes SO long to recharge if you are with display on	10
longer battery (One X+ should get a better battery	7
Hope it gets 12MP camera and record 1080p 60fps videos	9
this is the best phone really best display best design best build quality best internet and with the jelly bean this monster will be more awesome	10
Best display ever on a phone	10
Great camera	10
Playing games and watching videos on that gorgeous IPS LCD display is just orgasmic	10
Awesome Device !!
First Htc Device and will always opt for Htc Device till life !!
You know Benchmarks can be little different between Htc ONE X and Samsung Galaxy S3 but for day to day usage both phones are as fast !!
Display	10
screen flickering	10
The display was absolutely beautiful	10
The screen is mega amazing	10
High def true HD display - have to argue I feel its better than the AMOLED one on Galaxy Nexus	10
Immediately when you boot the phone you'll be amazed by the gorgeous screen! The colors are absolutely breath-taking and the resolution is top of the line	10
The gorilla glass on the screen is extremely durable resistant to scraches	10
The screen is slightly curved on it's edges which is a very nice touch especial when it comes to the feel of the phone and touching the edge of the screen	10
I've seen this phone put though a dryer and in another video the phone was scratched relentlessly with a key on both sides and I couldn't fine on scratch on it (Note: In the dryer video the phone was not taken out of the dryer but the phone screen was on the entire time and looked to be in great condition)	10

The phone did well on everything except for the face down drop in with the screen did crack	10
The camera is extremely fast from boot to shoot and the UI is fantastic	10
I've noticed that the photos are slightly over saturated but	10
not nearly enough to bother the quality of the photos	10
The detail of photos is great and the different modes and options that the camera gives you are very useful	10
The battery life on this device has improved after software update by HTC	8
It's very hard to find anything cons to this device especially after the battery update	8
Poor battery life and overheating means its useless for business use	2
A gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood phone very fast and an awesome camera but the wifi is not that good and the speakers is normal but it still an awesome device it deserve 10 out of ten for general usage	10
Smooth smart phone and Nice handling with such a large screen	10
in the starting i did had battery problem	9
but after the updates it gives awesome battery backup	9
Not everything but camera quality is poor than a 5mp camera	9
Playing games is excellent with its quadcore processor but get heated in few hours	10
Best build quality among all the android phones that have been out and an amazing screen	10
The screen looks extremely lifelike	10
after having it for a year the hardware slowly dies screen becomes unresponsive buttons harder to press down and general wear and tear shows easily	10
battery is sufficient for calls web browsing and everything else	7
The second problem was with the screen	8
The top right hand corner of my screen was poorly fitted and after only 2 weeks of use	8
The second problem was with the screen	8
The top right hand corner of my screen was poorly fitted and after only 2 weeks of use	8
The battery life of this device is poor as well	3
It reduces the enjoyment of using this handset because you will be constantly worrying about whether the battery will last until you reach your next charging opportunity	3
Since I bought this phone I have carried a back up battery charging pack with me as I go out and about	3
To illustrate how fast the battery drains	3
Camera is little bit disapointing as i was able to click better pics from my sensation	8
battery is good enough for me but doesn't last for more than a day on normal usage	9
and its LCD display get amazing picture with the technology of the IPS	10
Very big display	10
camera is very good	10
camera is very good	10
very fasy quad core processor	10
Very big display	10
but camera is slightly disappointing	8
Not seeing advertised battery life	6
Incredible display	10
although it'd be better if the battery would be improved a bit	6
Mult is ok
camera ass well	7
text not okay Display is weey better then sgs3 but worse then 4x hd	6
battery Weery bad for qurd core
( sorry for bad eng im rus :) )	3
very poor battery	1
Except for one thing maybe ; The battery life	8
Gorgeous screen and also very thin	10
the phone needs a cover( pouch) and the battery is not perfect	8
The camera is pretty awesome as i	9
The speed at which the cam focuses it amazing	9
280-pixel screen	10
and the first with a quad-core processor; its Nvidia Tegra 3 chipset even includes a GeForce graphics core and a "companion core" - a fifth processor core that takes over essential functions when the phone is idle to save power	10
7in screen's IPS panel is bright and colourful	10
if not quite as punchy as the OLED screens on the Motorola RAZR or Samsung Galaxy Nexus	10
The screen's contrast also can't match that of its rivals	10
Colours were on the vibrant rather than accurate side	10
The 720p resolution is ideal for web browsing; we could easily read headline and summary text on the BBC News homepage in landscape mode	10
The One X's screen is rounded at the edges and sits proud of its white surround	10
There's very little space around the screen	10
screens pretty nice and unique	10
but the UI makes me need only one hand to operate!!
Oh ya and the screen of the phone	10
The processor is so slow	1
Battery life is poor	4
CPU speed is not the adverstised 800Mhz	4
Screen is vibrant but not multi-touch	8
Camera is very crappy and no way is it 5MP	2
Video camera is just as poor and soesn't record sound very well	2
Photobuck always runs in the background	2
Battery life is ok at first but it does wear down quickly	3
0MP camera (I am a graphic designer and I use the heck out of a phone camera for all sorts of reasons)	1
Imagine my surprise when my first photo	1
looked like a watercolor painting	10
I also love screen real estate	10
One issue with the camera	9
while the 2gb of RAM mixed with the octo-core processor gives you seamless multitasking transition	10
the battery gives you upwards of 14 hours of moderate-heavy usage with the built in battery saver turned off	10
the minimalistic design gives speedy	10
) Can't be opened in separate windows occupying the home screen	10
The camera is a solid performer	9

One issue with the camera	9
Turn it on and the screen explodes with life	10
The colours are natural yet vibrant	10
and make you feel very special swishing through its screens as you do so	10
The battery-time is long	10
nice flat no sticking out cameras no rounds	9
2 inch screen with a resolution of 320x480 and has a very nice colors and lightning making it easy to see on sunlight but direct sunlight it is a little difficult	10
3 gingerbread but with a weak processor (600Mhz- single core) it actually is pretty fast going on menus and a couple of games	10
Rear camera could be better but it has a front camera which actually is very nice to see on a low-end device	7
Browser and overview of every home screen	10
battery life which is insanely great 2	10
battery life is a joke	2
somewhat slow interface (except for the camera	4
Touch screen keyboard on vertical position are a little hard to use if you have big hands	8
- DO NOT Buy if you r a big time application user
- Battery will not last more then 3 hr	2
- Everything works fine eceept huge problem with battery
- LCD is fine but will not see clear if you outside in sunlight you may have problem seeing if you have glasses it will hard to see it	2
The screen is fantastic and crystal clear	10
The sapphire screen is nothing to joke about	10
I think you'd have to REALLY try to actually damage the screen or even scratch it	10
I don't even use a screen protector	10
The back camera is good but isn't anything to boast about	8
The front facing camera is mediocre and probably only good for selfies or to be used as a mirror(isn't that all people use the front for anyways?)	8
The battery life is killer compared to any other phone I've seen	10

I recommend getting a case to cover the rest of the phone(screen doesn't exactly need one and it'd just make bubbles/lose sensitivity)	10
Plus you don't have to worry about the screen breaking	10
good processor	9
this smartphone features the durable Sapphire Shield™ display	10
(Why the camera lens isn't somehow covered by the holster I don't know	3
Came across this site while looking for possible resolutions	8
After a couple weeks the touch screen started freezing intermittently	2
The camera(s) are much better	10
The speed is much better than most phones I've seen	10
The quad core CPU does its job	10
The screen is much better and I love the Sapphire Screen	10
The battery can't be removed	10
(because it is waterproof all of the connectors have covers) The HD screen is surprisingly large as well	10
I can set it to work from any screen	10

Battery: Not the best	8
Solid B Grade on the battery life	8
So my opinion on the battery life may be a bit biased	8
it freezes it drops calls it getting to the point were imma trade this phone in or take it back the camera sucks	2
It has great battery life and is easy to carry without really noticing it	9
Camera quality could be better	5
Battery life is terrible	5
the screen is so small	5
and now the touch screen doesn't work at all so i can't even use my phone anymore	5
Very good battery backup	10
camera (front&rear;)	10
Display is much better than any other smartphones	10
Its huge 2500mah battery helps to hold charge more than 1 and half day from a single charge	10
2500 mAh battery and gesture capability are sounding like the most fun things ever	8
The phone also lasts for a really long time thanks to the 3000mAh battery	8
The camera is really good and taking selfies as well as video chatting on the phone is amazing	8
•	cast screen feature which lets me catch the action in my TV also	8
•	Display	8
color recreation good	8
•	selfie camera	8
0 front camera	8
•	13MP primary camera
•	sound quality	8
Cons
•	Non-removable battery
Overall verdict
I would recommend this phone as it power packed with superb features	9
My mobile battery get drain so fast	2
they told battery warranty only 6 months	2
Worst products only it will work 7 or 8 months after that battery will gone	2
I'm using this product from last one year everything are fine except Battery & heat up issue	3
but in terms on battery backup useless	3
battery problem	4
battery problem	4
Xolo X900 is a good phone compareable to the leaders in terms of speed and useability and multimedia performance	9
finally the display problem	2
it only looks good but doent have any memory n processor which is needed to run this andriod phone	2
This phone has everything to delight you like fast processor	9
8mp camera	8
3 front camera	8
back Camera (8MP)with LED Flash and Burst Mode (15 clicks in 1 second) + front camera (1	9
Display also Awesome	9
Clarity of display is too good	9
Camera is another factor	9
the battery life is disappointing	3
black and white display	4
than have the color display	4
In theory color display would be good for the internet browser on this phone--
but the browser is so piss poor	4
if you were inclined to squint at the screen	8
For my purposes the screen is plenty big	8
The battery life could be better	7
The touchscreen is good	9
touch-screen phone that is sturdy and works well	8
i have recently been finding some trouble with the battery	2
Its my first touch screen with Verizon	10
8 inches resistive touch screen but its actually pretty good	10
Better than most touch screens ive tried	10
Battery can last all day if not on the internet or send videos much	9
and battery is 1000mAh and has a talk time of bout 5 to 6 hrs and 22 days stand by time	9
The touchscreen never lags but sometimes hard to pick up the touch of your finger	7
Beautiful screen	10
I like the touch screen only gripe is that it's resistant not a big deal good enough screen	10
Anyway good phone but i wish it would have a better battery it gets killed as soon as i go on the internet	2
Very clear camera	8
and screen is amazingly bright	10
you can even love it because it has as video camera in it for the cheaper price	8
before this i had the LG Viewty and it had a very good camera	6
Its a basic camera with an "also can" attitude	6
Camera is better than nothing	6
other than the larger screen	8
This sucks and drains the battery	8
The phone allows a wide range of swapping movement to unlock the screen	10
This is bad because when the phone rings in your pocket and you reach for it - it is most likely you are gonna receive the call just by touching the screen in your pocket	10

Finally - the real problem I found is the battery behavior in out of reception area - like a marina	8
If I don't remember to shut it down before leaving - the phone drains the battery very quickly	8
I don't use the internet much so I don't care about connectivity situation and speed	8
Battery life is mediocre	6
LG optimus 3D achieves a solid job in creation and display of 3D right on the move	10
2 inch screen which is nice	7
and the bad thing is the display with only 125 ppi	7
Camera a big let down	3
however the battery life of this phone is very impressive	10
It however is a very durable phone and this is thanks to the touchscreen which is capacitive but actually plastic and not glass	5
The screen is actually fairly easy to type on	5
and although the screen is QVGA	5
keep in mind that this gives it the benefit of more performance and better battery life then HVGA counterparts as it only has half the pixels to power	10
the battery life on this thing is AMAZING	10
I'll end the day with at least half the battery left by the time I get to bed	10

the camera	4
display and android 2	4
display is only 125PPI	4
camera is very laggy and blurry	4
Also this phone has very good battery life	8
2 Inch screen is not that bad	8
the 800 Mhz processor Works Perfectly that'not bad at all in matter of fact it's great	10
there's only one thing bad about this phone which is it's grainy display at 125PPI	7
lets leave clear the battery its quite good	8
bright and vivid display	7
good battery	9
Battery can hold 1 day of average use	8
good for a 800mhz single core ARM/Qualcomm processor	10
Screen-wise	4
is a big 4 inch screen that dominates 95% of the front of the phone	4
the Screen resolution is 320x480	4
its not a good screen	4
The 5MP Camera also does a great job with details and brightness	8
it was good but my internal screen got cracked	10
the only big con with it is that it doesn't have an internal camera	8
I would suggest those who are willing to have a big screen display at an affordable price can go for it	10
bigger battery and dual sim functionality	10
On reality this phone is slightly smoother when compared to optimus black(thanks to Jellybean) and I get an average battery life of 2	10
The camera is good in strong lighting conditions	9
Fast processor	9
great camera	8
amazing screen and a very chap price make this phone best for everyday usage	9
It can even play heavy games very smoothly and it's battery can last for a lot	9
The battery is excellent	6
The screen often hanged	7
Nice sized screen and the version of OS is good	9
GREAT SCREEN	9
had no problem running any apps from google play

Camera	10
Battery is very good	10
phone for all who love big display	10
The camera is terrible in low light and high light as it is crispy as f**k	1
the battery is the issue	6
The display isn't to bad even for it's low specs	6
It'll uphold scratches but it's important to get a screen protector	6
While at the home screen it seems to transition well while any apps aren't running	6

It has a large screen	10
fast processor	10
and also a very nice display and decent 5MP cam	8
I am happy about his great screen	8
his dual-core processor and about he like a phone	9
I have the t-Mobile version but they are pretty much he same besides the screen size and the lack of ambient light sensors	9
and poor battery life that deteorated significantly over time	6
The resolution and media playback are terrible	6
i still love it but the camera was not my favorite part of this phone and when i use it it feels weird because im used to using a super snappy phone so it feels really slow but actually its not that slow	6
just the single core processor	9
it worked well for six months until the touch screen stopped working and didn't respond	6
the camera	10
It would be easier for me to take pictures if it has a camera button	10
I recently discovered how to take good pics outdoor :) You just have to explore the camera setting of this phone	10
This was my first touchscreen mobile phone	9
didn't scroll or switch between screens smoothly at all	9
or the Samsung touch screens	9
On the plus side it has a pretty decent battery for an android phone	9
Nice mobile but some features like camera	7
processor and no 3g video call make average mobile	9
i should remove battery and i should use it	9
Only disadvantage you will get is with the camera	6
as camera is really average	6
you are not lookng for a camera phone	6
The Processor is decent with 600MHz CPU	8
2 inch Display is outstanding	10
decent resolution	10
superb colours	10
The camera despite of being 3MP is of very good quality but flash is missed very much	8
camera too because not have LED flash	5
display not as good as Nokia	5
battery 1500 mAh but not long to use	7
UI speed good	8
there are so many more options than the wave and apart from the camera which is pretty bad  im loving every minute	7
Battery is one of the best	9
Battery life is something to definitely be improved on	3
Camera works great	9
no grainy or color-distorted pictures	9
only the nagging about the device is lacking of 5 megapixel camera and no LED flash	10
only the nagging about the device is lacking of 5 megapixel camera and no LED flash	6
take decent photos	9
no frontal camera for video skype or fring calls	6
Screen response can be slightly better I feel	9
the camera is not that great	6
Deserved something like a 5 MP camera	6
display is very clear	10
Battery backup is also good for such a big phone	10
battery	10
and the Handset comes with screengaurd sticked	10
the camera	10
Never had a serious problem wth it and when I did have a prob I just removed battery and replaced it in about 30 seconds and everything was fine! Not sure what others are talking about as we have four of them and similar stories to mine	9
but in the end it built good but you can't take good photo you can't play game and need more room to text	2
the display starting reversing both content and color anyway	5
Not even a battery pull worked	8
Randomly the battery will not charge; I will unplug it in the morning after several hours on the charger and it will die before lunch	8
it was all good the first 3 months but then the camera and audio was starting to have really bad quality	2
The touch screen was nice though! Until it scratched profusely at first contact with keys in my pocket	3
The camera is okay	6
a portion of the screen will lightly flicker	3
when you turn it on it skips the lock screen and goes straight to what you were just doing	3
The problem with this is that the display still treats it like the lock screen and pits it to sleep after about 8 seconds	3
with a touch screen	3
It's a good transition to a touch screen though if you aren't familiar with using it though!
So all in all	3

So all in all	3
It is my first touchscreen phone	9
The touchscreen is quite sensetive and very responsive	9
The camera on this phone really caught me by surprise	10
The light sensor allows for very sharp photos	10
No grainy mobile phone photos here!
Audio playback is great	10
The touch screen is suppose to be capacitive instead of resistive	7
when receaving a text the phone will notify you with a bubble on the screen	7
altho the screen could be a little bit wider	7
If you have never owned a touch screen before this phone can be un user friendly
Overall if LG would fix these 2 issues	7
battery cover has a nice grippy	8
On the lock screen the time is displayed along with the date slide it up to reveal 5 homescreens which can hold many widgets	10
The camera is somewhat good	6
LG squeezed the most out of this 2 Mega Pixel shooter that they could with dull washed colors	10
but at 15 fps this camera is terrible	6

other than the camera	6
It has an good battery life but you'll navigate slow on the internet due to the low-end hardware	8
after that it was good for about 6 months then 2 weeks ago i had to send it in because the screen went black	2
the screen is black yet again	2
plus battery quality is horrible ill charge it all night and it's still dead in the am even after a battery swap	1
The internet may not be as high speed as other phones today	3
The display is small and seems to only produce around 15 colors	4
I really liked the camera	8
The display was good	8
but the battery life was kind of short	5
The worse part about this phone is the touch screen	2
the touch screen never actually works correctly	2
The battery life sucks and sometimes it will say full bars then two seconds later	1
not a good phone for music
Camera: It's not horrible	3
UI speed: Quite slow	2
The touchscreen is really annoying	2
it never seems to work right
Battery life is horrible (like most phone)	2
This phone has great reception! Camera is awesome	10
and the touch screen is too sensitive	10
The touch screen can be prompted by anything touching it	10
The camera is OK when outside	2
the touch screen is too inaccurate for the web browsing and is also too slow when trying to scroll through the browser	10
Finally the touch screen started going bad	2
I've had it for about 1 1/2 years now and I would still love it if the touch screen would still work and it does sometimes but not very well	2
The touch screen often turns all black or all white and becomes unresponsive and the phone will have to be turned off and on again	5
terrible dont buy it  touch screen breaks randomly shuts off and totally resets all your setting	4
the outside screen goes then the inside screen	4
by far it is the worst! the touch screen does't work  and will go blank or power down	1
The camera works okay not the best	2
it has a good camera	8
ok touchscreen	8
The screen gets all messed up and then you shut it down and it wont turn back on	2
the battery life is terrible and you it always restarts all the time	2
Short battery life in constant usage	7
Camera and flash is worthless as compared to its other rivals	5
I will use it for watching videos and camera	8
A 5-inch screen phone	10
with a quad-core processor	10
with its quad-core processor	9
2GB internal space for app installation; and its touchscreen is responsive to taps and swipes	10
Android 5 version with good display (218 ppi)	9
Colour reproduction was superb (16	9
7 M colours)	9
5mp primary camera with led flash was average	5
main major problem was 1950mAh battery	5
If u r normal user u can get around 1 day battery backup	5
battery was heats up fast while playing games	5
replaceable battery and SD slot - what more can a man want! PS: Phonearena review and score is so 2014	9
It has a really good screen (neglect iPhonearena reviews) and with the continuum feature	10
battery is not very good	9
Battery could be better (it's average) and the build quality could feel more premium (but it feels solid) but still - Lumia 950 has some unique features	7
put everything you use on start screen	10
Put that all on start screen	10
you can do instantly :)
But Windows 10 has some bugs in this "tile making" so you gotta use "Custom Tiles Maker" app for being able to pin website with custom icon to start screen :)	10
Excellent camera	10
Great display	10
Good battery life	9
The camera is outstanding	10
The OS and UI experience are very good but the battery could last a little longer and sometimes it does run a bit on the hot side	8
The camera produces very sharp bright images	10
I use my phone a lot during the day and would have liked to see the battery a little more robust	9
good camera	10
amoled display is better for me	10
camera even with 5MP is really amazing	9
front camera is kinda good not at all	9
you cant complain about battery because motorola is make the best among android devices	9
huge battery = awesome phone	9
i wish it had 900 at umts so it could be able to get 3g from orange dominicana but well it works at 850 for claro
display: scratch resistant is a must for me so im glad it has a gorilla glass	10
The dual core processor and 1 Gig of system ram make this phone fly	10
The high definition content displays great and games display great as well	10
I also own the multimedia dock and it displays very great on a 55" HD display	10
good screen	8
but touch screen (digitizer) is too fragile	9
due to the tegra 2 processor	10
It has a nice responsive touch screen	10
I am a constant Facebook and Google+ user and the battery holds up great for me	10
with a decent battery life and so forth	10
and did not have a large screen since i have small hands	8
It was a good phone for the first 3 days then it was so buggy and the screen was terrible	2
This is the best phone I've ever used! I love the 4G a lot!
The screen size is a very good and the phone charges fast	10
battery wasnt holding up to what was expected	6
The screen was gorgeous	8
The Nvidia Tegra2 processor is great	10
The battery life is excellent and everything else works perfectly	9
AT&T;'s 4G is not up to speed yet so I haven't been able to explore this	8
when I looked at the display in the store	10
Also this has that impressive dual core processor	8
I like the panoramic and highly customizable home screen	10
If I had to complain about anything it's be that the speaker and camera are not as good as my sony ericsson c905a	8
what i will dwell on is the battery life	10
and texting and still sits at 20-30 percent battery at midnight when i go to sleep	10
the camera seems lacking since i had the htc pure	8
and then captivate and all had a 5MP camera	8
the screen isn't as clear as the iphone 4	10
but it looks nicer than the cappy's super amoled any day with the higher resolution	10
speaking of higher resolution	10

The Battery Life is interesting	9
Moto and Android give you different ways to manage battery power through task managers and power profiles	9
fingerprints on a touch screen	10
It takes beautiful HD photos and has many different profiles bright LEDs	8
The dual core processor and 1 Gig of system ram make this phone fly	10
Game play and picture resolution is great	10
Camera is okay quality	7
Screen is great both in the sense of size and quality	9
Camera is on the level with the likes of Sony Experia Arc and iPhone 4	9
the Atrix battery is somewhat juicier	9

screen	10
battery	9
The worst part is the camera	6
my previous phone N8 has better camera and it's from 2010	6
Battery is longlasting and it fills very quickly	10
In my opinion camera is not bad at all because i think if one wants great camera then buy real camera device!	9
the battery is average	9
i use it every day and im happy with it the only "bad"thing its the camera	5
Camera was great	7
Battery struggles to make it any longer than 12 hours	1
Make a 20 minute phone call and you it drains your phone battery to almost nothing	1
Battery sucked	1
The camera quality is wonderful	8
It comes in different colors though mine is black	7
The phone is resistant (a little heavy) and the display is fine	9
The camera is one of the worst things of the phone: 3 MP without flash; the only good at this	4
is that you can take panoramic photos	4
and the screen fell off when it was dropped	4
and the camera is decent	8
however it kills me how slow the phone is! It is has about a 2-4 second delay to do pretty much anything! I recently got the blue screen	5
The only issue I've had was when I broke the screen/digitizer by hardly hitting it	8
great battery given that it's a basic phone	9
those times when a battery is not a big deal	9
have good battery life	9
I dont understand why I have to rate camera as this phone doesnt have a camera	4
I hate my Nokia 2330 beucouse it laggs so much and camera is bulls**t!!!!!!
Never buy this phone its suck	2
What annoys me more is the battery cover which don´t fix correctly and I can´t access my email shurely for not having the correct configuration	7
In my opinion the camera is crap	10
There's the battery and then the RAM	4
a processor of 1GHz during the time this phone was released	5
don't be surprised to see a person with their hand on top of the screen trying to block the sun to look at it	6
but poor memory and camera lets it down	5
Its very strong and its screen and body is of high quality	6
But the low memory keeps irritating you and its camera is another major let down	5
Standby battery may last 300+ hours	6
the battery would run out rapidly	6
The touch display also doesn't respond very well	7
The internet speed I found it a little slow	4
I have a 10Mb/s internet speed and it felt like using a 56Kb/s one	4
Battery timings is really bad	2
there goes down your battery	2
Camera is ok	7
Its battery timing sucks	1
it has best audio qua;ity with good camera	9
but battery timing is worst	1
responsive touch screen	9
battery timing is average	8
Well 5530 is overall a nice built phone by nokia with alot of functionalities but with a serious drawback of battery timing	6
good multimedia functionality and an impressive indoor camera	9
this awesome celphone has a terrible problem its te battery life
so if somebody tells you that it is a bad phone or something like that
believe the only thing that is bad in the cellphone is the battery life
i have this awesome cellphne and every fay i use it for many things so i think that if youre looking at a cellphone choose it	3
And there was 1 time which my phone just vibrates non-stop(not sure why) till I have to take off the battery and turn it on again lols	6
Wi-fi was nice bt sometimes it can't display all of the images inside a webpage	9
Some apps were cool like the photo viewer and I'm using slideunlock	8
4 days of battery life with loads of texting bt no wi-fi or bluetooth	6
I wanted a phone with great sound and touchscreen and this is the 1 I'm looking for	9
And it'll last a long time also if you take good care for it like I do I'm putting a case and screen protector on it	9
Its overall a Good Phone but very Poor Battery life with talk time of 4 hrs and standby upto a day	1
Overall nice phone but battery is very poor	1
has good memory ut however the LED screen sucked	5
! And ofcourse the 5 MP camera enthralled me	10
The camera is horrible	1
i have to charge it every night because the battery dies around 6 or 7 i completely hate it	2
The battery cover did have a tendency to slide off	3
good camera	10
0 mega pixel camera
i think its better than the nokia n95 10 times better
its got maps	10
camera quality is good	10
camera sound off option is not available	10
The camera is bad enough to be chalked down to a faulty unit	7
Screen size is an issue too	10
the ClearBlack AMOLED touchscreen isn’t big enough for comfortable typing	10

The Asha 201 comes with an camera which	5
There is no flash for the camera	5
fair battery life	6
great camera and has a flash	10
to web browsing & connectivity & to top it off with excellent connectivity & call quality it brilliant
on the multimedia side the set isn't far from the brilliant nokia n95 either delivering superb music quality with clear sound which a also quite loud
as for the camera which had traditionally been a weak spot of nokia e series sets except for e90 this set is awesome with superb still pictures at par with n95 though video recording is not upto the mark but quite acceptable for a business set
in short to call e72 as a business set does not do justice to it's capabilities as a multimedia capabilities which are just as good
this is the perfect professional allrounder set of it's time & I can say it's better than even the n95s	7
http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Nokia-E73-Mode_id4656/reviews/sort/default/page/1	Small screen and Symbian make for a fairly mundane phone	2
http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Nokia-E73-Mode_id4656/reviews/sort/default/page/1	The camera is a highlight	9
what I like most is the design and display	9
which I hate is the front camera	8
displays the message:Resuming	9
Camera performance is also a nice surprise	10
and outstanding camera that works very well at night	10
Also not the perfect phone if a lot of the time you're using it to take quick photos	10
the camera takes time to open and shoot the photo	10
Yet the quality of photo itself is really outstanding for such a cheap phone	10
Warranty also changed the battery of the phone	10
Glance screen is god send	10
930 battery life not as good and does not have replaceable battery	9
Battery life - i am an extremely heavy user as this is my business phone and constantly on pone calls and the calendar	9
I am not totally sure why the battery life is so dramatically better	9
so i am ecstatic with battery life!

Screen - great
3	9
Speed - again pleasantly surprised	10
Camera - a step up from 920 and much faster loading

Easy to remove back cover for removable battery is a great feature and must have	9

Battery: You might want to reconsider this model if you are a power user	8
WhatsApp and Facebook seem to drain the battery really quickly!	8
Phone performs very excellent and good battery	10
Better hardware then Lumia 930/Icon (except for the camera)	10
excellent camera	10
I'll start saying about battery life	9
but it only drops one block of battery in only about5 or 6 hours continuously	9
The best battery compared to it's price	9
better battery life than iphone (although this is low featured phone compared to iphone)	9
but it doesn't even use a little block of 5 battery blocks (on the status bar)	9
Better Display	6
Camera	6
Processor and Design	9
You can find other colors	6
The Camera is also good but not great	6
Battery life is also good	8
It's still a good phone the downside is that you cannot download that much apps and not an android phone BUT a good camera	6
display	6
processor	9
But the screen is really small	5
Pictures taken with this camera has a lot of noise	4
good camera	5

battery life	8
beautiful screen	10
The screen in top notch	9
I love the speed of the processing for anything and the LTE in my area is superb	10
Camera quality was awesome	9
also battery is pretty awful	6
it eats battery like crazy for no reason had a hard time charging to 100%	6
bottom half of the screen had sensitivity issues afterwards as well	8
I know battery is a little bit smaller but still from 0-100% takes about 1hr13min almost no phone does this	10
Now the real bad about this phone:
Screen is not so good	5
colors are washed out and any flagship really looks better than this	5
0 touch screen was sooo bad and you can google about it	5
Mine was the worst and after 5 hours in a vertical position it simply couldn’t detect my fingers in about 50% of the screen	5
This thing specs better then an apple 6s plus!  I don't even use 50% battery in a day most times	10
The camera takes very cool and high quality photos even in dark time	10
I made photos with stars! The iPhone camere is bulls**t after this	10
the camera quality	10
A few months ago my screen started to act up to the point that it would randomly open apps	4
great phone for an excellent price tag and great overall experience! I love the build quality of the phone and also the display is great but it has a yellowish tone which is not cool to see compared to something like the xperia z3 display or even an iphone 6 display! But still a Solid phone	8
The camera on the Samsung and Apple phones is better than on this device	8
with 400 euros i bought myself a nice Nikon DSLR witch is better than any smartphone camera would every be)
I like phones	8
the display is superb	9
the battery excellent!
Coming from a Nexus 5	10
where I really had to be careful about my usage in order to reach home with some juice left in the battery	10
photo shooting	8
You cannot kill this battery in one day! ( don t be silly	10
I have an annoying issue with video where the camera just pulses in and out of focus	8
Camera=NO CustomerCare=NO(they dont even have call number	3
Long lasting battery	9
I love the speed of the processing for anything and the LTE in my area is superb	10
I have done zero efforts to limit my usage or save any battery	10
utterly fantastic display	10
top of the line snapdragon processor	10
specially its battery life and less charge time	10
and the camera allows to take very good photos in every condition	9
The screen is very briliant	10
In terms of battery	10
its fast and smooth with  amazing 13mp camera	9
The camera is amazing with 13mp and 4k video especially slow motion 120fps	10
Also the battery is great and lasts plenty enough for a day	10
i use it with 4g 3 houres 5 days a week while i am listening to music and playing on it but in the evening it still has 25% battery left! And my 4g is always on!	10
I'm not much of a camera user	9
but I have seen better Cameras	9
Camera is great	10
Battery is great	9
Clear display	8
I have compared it to the GN3 and S5 and it is better than them in camera	9
the display and performance (based on benchmarks)	10
5 1080p display is sharp and have rich colours	10
The Camera they are using is great	9
The battery life is excellent but I'm a bit spoiled by the Z2; undoubtly sony does batteries better than anyone else	9
The camera has given me good results; The rule is simple with the camera: Get more light	9
My Iphone 5s had a better camera no doubt	9
The display is just	10
I literally own a tablet and I choose to watch youtube videos on my phone simply because of how amazing this screen is	10
I genuinely believe the display and build alone are worth the price	10
great camere and fantastic screen	10
What's not to like about this phone? Lacking a bit of speed because of the processor	7
OS and screen - that's all what is in this phone nice	9
the camera can shoot still photos at 5 megapixles	9
I returned my iphone 5 due to small screen	10
The screen looks constantly dirty from finger prints and sliding across the screen	5
Screen touch response and sensitivity is good	8
the battery life is awful	1
and the camera sucks	2
It has some great camera quality and call quality is amazing	10
It also recently started saying that it has an non supported battery when it is the original battery from when I got it and yes it is a Samsung battery	4
i dont like the battery life because i text constantly and it seems to die every 6 or 7 hours	5
but maybe i just need a new battery	5
THIS CAMERA JUST PLAIN SUCKS	5
This phone has merits such as good touch screen	9
colour depth is good	9
b5722 demerits are:1 At taking photo when flash light is on then photo taken is only light no photo or very poor image	5
more over in d880 there is auto focus while in b5722 ther is no autofocus which needs more experties while taking photo	5
it's your 1st choice
if you wanna 3G phone Or Camera quality	7
mobile was super and sound quality and camera very nice	10
battery is major problem	10
mobile was super and sound quality and camera very nice	10
battery is major problem	10
Photo/Video syn is need improvement	6
battery doesn't support more than one day (do not use it to take some pictures and to listen music	1
the dual sim and the camera are good	7
Samsung B-7722 it good who is looking for all in one but the minor problem was battery	3
Display is too bright in my opinion	9
The colors are displayed vibrantly	9
Camera is decent	5
the phone won't display anything that has a name more than 52 characters	9
you have to remove the battery to get to the microSD card	6
I can't really judge on battery life	6
and hate the camera	1
The battery is great	9
amazing screen	9
and long battery	2
This was my first truly BIG smartphone and i must say it was just that!   The battery life was very poor but everything else about this phone blows the doors ( or cases off) everything else	6
Pretty heavy hourly usage and I get about 10hrs battery	9
Pretty heavy hourly usage and I get about 10hrs battery	9
For some reason Samsung didn't test their keyboards well and all but the stock Android one cover up parts of the screen like Send Buttons	9
The talk of the screen being too big is ridiculous	10
you will not want a smaller screen	10
I believe this screen size will be the standard in the future but a thinner phone	10
along with all 4 display models at the store	4
has bad graphics/screen issues with displaying dark shades	4
Camera	10
The big display is nice I can text well without mashing three buttons so it's faster for me and with swipe and voice to txt I don't even have to the s-pen is great I find my self circleing this on pics and sending them to people to show exactly what I mean	10
amazing screen	10
and long battery	10
Great camera	9
Great display	9
5 inch screen to a 5	10
3 inch screen	10
The screen is beautiful	10
I AM ELBARAMONY:
MY OPINION:-
when you used to use it for 10 days you will not be able to return to the small screen dimension again - all mobiles you will  feels so small	9
difficult to write in comparing with galaxy note with big pretty screen and wonderful android operating system	9
The colors and resolution are amazing	10
but the battery life is not that good on 3g	8
I consider this phone is the best phone ever made by samsung even the latest one SIII from samsung
It has great build quality but plastic amazing outdoor camera performance and bad indoor performance	4
Love the screen size and readability	10
Most web pages easily navigated even in portrait mode without pinch-zoom and needing to pan around the screen	10
i cant take screens less than four inches serious anymore	10
Best smartphone iv used swift and quick flicking and swiping through messages to phone book to using apps on screen even with loads of widgets running on windows
Oh and that screen is amazing
Hope ICS is out soon :)	10
Multimedia 10/10: Witht he Super AMOLED HD screen makes viewing pictures and videos a plus	10
I don't know why somepeople do this b/c the resolution on the Note is 1280x800 not 1920x1080	10
UI Speed 9/10: Smooth for the most part	9

I don't know why somepeople do this b/c the resolution on the Note is 1280x800 not 1920x1080	10
UI Speed 9/10: Smooth for the most part	9
Battery 9/10: I'm a big battery user and I get 5-6hrs	9
You get a 2500mah battery which is half the amount used in 10	9
Very smooth and text is easy to read b/c of the WXGA resolution	10
Camera 10/10: This is a mobile phone is by far one of the best camera out there on a mobile handset	10
Pictures are crisp and colorful	10
Display: One of the main reasons to get it of not the main reason	10
The Super AMOLED HD has a resolution of 1280x800 not 1280x720 like the Galaxy Nexus or Optimus LTE(ATT Nitro HD)	10
5/10 only b/c of not producing a Super AMOLED+ HD screen since it would look better	10
Their tiny and you won't notice the splotches at all if you have other colors around	10
Amazing large screen	10
I only wish the battery is more powerfull	9
Sure if samsung sell a 3000mAh battery I will replace my 2500mAh original battery	9
The hardware components of the Samsung Galaxy Note perfectly complements the software that comes with it and the display	10
has become too heavy for the RAM and CPU	5
Excellent big SAMOLED display with 16:10 ratio is perfect for book reading and web surfing	9
About the battery	10
i cant complain much as the os is still not on the upgrade yet but still the battery life is good enough and os is still functioning great	10
Main plus side is the screen size	9
the battery is really bad	2
the camera	10
but one my complaints just the battery usage	8
i saw different between the two:
my galaxy note: the screen in white color is not clear if compared with the second G	8
note
my galaxy note:the camera flash is strongest than the second G	9
note
my galaxy note: made in vietnam and  the other made by samsung
but i saw the third galaxy note one with my friend made in vietnam with same color of my second G	8
note (white colore is clear)	8
30 inches) Fast mobile data support (4G)
High pixel densitiy screen	10
screen quality is superb	9
Battery sucked after 1 year of heavy use	1
Now the phablet collects dusk because I got tired of replacing the OEM battery every year	1
I bought this phone after hearing about it's display and i am loving it	10
except for the camera i love all aspects of this phone
in my opinion camera dont even desrve  5
video playing capacities are seam less	7
a pretty phone with curved display from 2012	5
Camera result is Much better	10
vivd screen	10
the battery is amazing 2 days for moderate use	10
the internet browsing speed is unbelievably faster	7
the battery stands for more than 9 hours of continuous GAMING usage	9
and the screen is really not that great	3
3 inch screen	3
internet speed is good but the browser lags so much	3
UI speed is not that great	3
after the gameplay when u return to the home screen phone lags and crashes	3
The Samsung Galaxy S II is a touchscreen-enabled	10
2 GHz dual-core "Exynos" system on a chip (SoC) processor	9
[12][13]
The user-replaceable battery gives up to ten hours of heavy usage	10
very sexy very fast and with a great screen	9
very nice colours and compare to other quad core smartphones the delay on internet is only 2 seconds	9
and that is its cheap processor and GPU	9
call quality is good but you can hear the call sound from the phones back just under the camera and this is a problem with this model	6
screen colours are bit off the charts and give you a hint of a bluish tint as most of the AMOLED screen owners complain	7
I would be expecting more with more room to fit a larger camera in there	8
even than the iPad 2
- Materials and Textures feel natural to grip
- Very bright screen
- Verizon LTE is Amazing - averaging 12Mbps down / 3Mbps upstream in Los Angeles
Cons:

Reasons for good camera is they have enabled beauty mode default specially for selfie	10

The overall Samsung Galaxy A5 review tells about the Super AMOLED display with high reliability with great contrast and punchy colors	10
The overall Samsung Galaxy A5 review tells about the Super AMOLED display with high reliability with great contrast and punchy colors	10
One of the standout features of the Galaxy A5 is its camera	10
I don't mind the non removable battery but 2600mAh is way less than enough for daily  use	6
It's exynos cpu might be powerful (50000 on antutu) but no app is optimized well enough and the lag is irritating	3
The front facing camera takes good pictures in daylight	4
and the body to screen ratio is great	9
Camera is good in most occasions but no OIS means you can get blurry pics sometimes	7
Display is good in terms of both sharpness and color production	9
7 inch sAMOLED screen is a joy to watch	9
Battery life is the department it excels most	10
You can consistantly get upwards of 6:30 hour screen on time up to astonishing 9:30 hour SOT	9
dood quality of fideo(hd light) and photos	9
Display resolution ok	8

cpu speed is normal for this price	10
The Galaxy Ace 3 (LTE Model) is very good because of the camera	10
The internet is great but the display is not good enough because it's TFT it would be better if it was AMOLED Display The everyday usage is great	8
Display size is 4 inches	10
Processor is the best(for me)	10
battery is avearge	9
but LTE version has 1800mAh battery	9

The phone's battery saver and ultra battery saver work very well	10
and really do extend battery life	10
Camera is working fast with no problems good focus and nice video quality	10
One very peculiar issue is the camera's inability to capture pictures	2
clear photo (which is hard)	2
the only issue can be the battery but that's no big deal	6
The screen is very clear and the colors look great	9
It seems to be running ingress ok n though the battery life is terrible	4

If you're into photography	10
Even the 41MP camera of the Nokia 1020 is no match for the optical zoom that the K Zoom provides	10
It opens up so many more possibilities for photos and videos	10
its clearer photo in low light and many more	10
Its camera quality is excellent	10

The screen is to small to type and see what you are writing at the same time	7
and too small battery life  its just an electronic phone to put in pocket or to say i have a phone	3

It is basical samsug desing and that same boring android

The texting screen also seems to be easily overwhelmed	9
Network speed and overall computational power has been nicely upgraded considering this phone's price	5
it was BLAZING fast at the time since no one else was using it!  This phone had a great screen	10
Excellent camera and multimedia performance	10
5" display allows you to enjoy and have a great multimedia experience on this phone	10
The LTE speeds on this phone are amazing	10
I have gotten speeds up to 57 Mbps down and 15 Mbps up in Phoenix	10
not to mention the LG Nitro gave me slightly slower data speeds then the Skyrocket	10
and the Blistering Data Speeds are out of this world @ 22mbps to 26	10

The Battery has been much more reliable and long lasting then I expected	10
I think that cause the reception is so good around here or with this phone that the battery does not get wasted by the phone looking for signal all the time	10
and the battery in this phone have been lasting me that long which is by far much longer then any phone i ever had	10
Camera is actually pretty good though there is a annoying dark spot that always shows up on my pictures and i did clean it recently	8
the battery is pretty good	7
I cracked my screen	6
i have noticed that the screen isn't as good as everyone says hard to see in direct sunlight	6
the phone still packs a lot of power under the hood with it's dual core processor clocked at 1	10
5" AMOLED display shows a little pixelation	9
but otherwise is very vivid and colorful	9
The battery life is pretty user dependent	8
The camera provides excellent quality photo and video	9
I was originally worried about the relatively low PPI sported by the display	9
but all of those worries left when I saw it firsthand - it provides beautiful colors and HD quality definition	9
I believe this is because the display technology increases the perceived resolution (by up to 50%	9
The Super AMOLED Plus display also gives the best contrast	9
colors	9
and if you use black backgrounds you'll actually save battery life	8
Battery life could be better	8
Battery life can also be improved by buying batteries with higher mAH (the original battery is 1850 mAH	8

Its big and good but the battery could be better and plus I would want something bigger like the Note which I will get the second one	7
The battery life sucks really bad and its get to hot to fast	7

AT&T; Samsung GS2 and AT&T; Samsung GS2 Skyrocket
I currently have both of these devices of course Exynos chip set just little bit on the faster side when you flicking screens side to side if you have the devices sitting next to each other other that there is no lag at all it a very fast responsive device at&t; GS2 has smaller screen skyrocket is bigger when it comes to graphics display size matter chipset	10

This one is easy to root - that's one thing I love about it and it has a high speed	10
I had a Samsung rugby sport that was built very well and had good battery life	2

The screen looks great and can be used with gloves	9
Great phone and lookes good in all three colors	9
It's display is so sharp and clear	10
Aqua mode is an awesome camera addition	10

Almost double the processor	10
It is tied with the S5 Active for best outdoor camera of any phone	10

Iphone friends break their glass when their phone is falling or cannot change battery when it stops working	8
The camera is pretty good and the flash is a huge bonus	9
The battery life is alright lasts me about 2 to 3 days	7
camera works well but compared to the lumia 520 not that great but over the lumia 520 it has 1 advantage which is that it has the flash light	4
front camera is nothing great	4
the battery life is pretty decent	7
A Best Buy phone in my opinion! Good camera (it has a LED flash and records 720p)	8
it has a front camera (i mean come on what more can you ask :) ) the ux nature UI is nice and reliable	8
but found a solution by deactivate auto-sync functions from google photos	10
but found a solution by deactivate auto-sync functions from google photos	10
as well as sucking on the phones battery	7
The solution is a backup battery with 5000maH (around 30$) that I place in my backpack and care along with me	7
its very good battery back also good	9
the screen switched orientation for every program	8
I also am not fond of the camera it kinda sucks! the calls aren't very good either if you are out of town like the next state it is not very good!	3
The web browser is pretty good; can display some HTML desktop pages that take longer to load and risk freezing the phone	9

The battery life is very good- if your not using the web too long	6
The camera is good	8

The samsung monte is a good phone the camera is excelent the internet is easy and very useful	9
But the battery life sucks!! And the lack off no qwerty keyboard lets the phone down	6
prefer touchscreen though	7
It's a great phone with a great music-player and a camera that can take reallly nice pictures (video quality is not that good)	8
the capacitive touchscreen is AMAZING and you can even customize your font that you like to see on your menu	9
The call quality is not that good and your battery is almost dead after a few pictures :( But the phone is REALLLY easy to use!!!	7
Good non touch screen phone	9
has some interesting features and has a pretty decent camera	9
the pictures can be very good for a camera phone	9
The display is nice and big for a phone of this type	10
The camera is alright	7
The touchscreen kept going off and it would be very annoying	1
and the battery life is greater then any phone ive ever had	10
the camera is good and the ringer is loud	7
if you like epic battery life	10
this phone has epic battery life	10
Battery charges fast	10
but does NOT work with In Car Blue tooth Adapters!!! pioneers (cd-btb200) to be exact! Battery life is Great	9
The camera does lack in quality but its what you get for for a free phone	7
drop it on its screen (opened or closed)	9
The display screen is bright enough for you to get the job done and recognize it	9
The battery is exquisite and lasts a really long time between charges	10
the battery lasts for about 2 days after talking for about 30 minutes per day	1
the screen unlocks itself in my pocket	1
but not all is good working(

its a really very good camera	10
in still photos it is good	10

good camera and video recorder	10
fast bluetooth and gorilla glass display (scratch resistant)	10
for those who complains about the battery life: when i first bought it	10
the battery ho
ded jus for one-two days and i was very dissapointed	10
it just lighten up the screen	10
now my battery keeps working even after a week while listening to music !	10
brilliant screen	10
incredible movie watching experience    very good headphones  VERY NICEE built quality     bada is very easy to use and the music player is just astonishing with all that colours and the cds that are showing off when you rotate the device	10
camera macro is better than my DSLR and I am not kidding	10
Solid camera	8
3-inch WVGA Super AMOLED display	10
while there’s a 5-megapixel camera with LED flash and autofocus	10
Keeping things running is Samsung’s own 1GHz Hummingbird processor	10
!@!!!!!!just too gud fone to have the super amoled screen can beat any fone in market in world n now bada had many interesting apps n every one likes them its ultimate fone	10
if i press and hold the end call button more than  6 or 7 seconds my wave shuts down even when the screen is locked	10
and that really bothers me because it accidentally turns off in my pocket and when I want to use it it requests the pin code due to the inefficient screen and key lock	10
ites very nice mobile in every thing i bought too much mobiles last 10 years but its different screen and sound and all multimedia is very very good and its solid mobile
last 2 month its fall down from me but nothing effectd and the screen anti scratch
its smooth and good design	10
the ui is very smooth  and camera  is excellent	10
i love  the  SUPER AMOLED display  its the best!!!!!!  i hope that samsung can  develop nice applications  for bada  because its the  only thing  stopping  this phone from being perfect !!!!	10
so the apps arent good most of them you have to pay for but otherwise the camera and internet is really clear and fast	10
The Samsung S8500 Wave has a marvelous Super AMOLED touchscreen	10
a nice camera	9
When I see what COULD the Wave handle(Need for Speed shift	10
Not so with the XP3300: its battery life is epic	10
The camera's not great (But	6
even touchscreen work very well	10
Camera is conventional	8
but still can't beat an DSLRs 8mp camera	8
the camera is only good in sunlight but not so gud in indoors and specialy at night	4
But the camera has some good camera functions such as face detection and smile shutter	4
Later it started to slow down the functions
Now I have a double screen! One on top of the other and sometimes even mirrored	5
with its terrible camera	1
memory the size of a goldfish and battery life of someone from "the biggest loser" on a treadmill	2
It is a phone dedicated to music and it also has a good camera	9
You can film and take photos with it (as long as you don't plan on having incredible-quality videos/photos	9
firstly (I think this may be a defect of only my phone) dust always enters in the front camera's location and it can be quite annoying	9
5 MP camera of sony is far better than an 8 MP cam of samsung	10
Summary - The phone is great to use every day and with most of it small problems they can be fixed via the apps like the slow ish internet browser and pour camera ui	8
Over than them to problems the phone is great the best single cpu android device you can get	9
lv pretty much everything about it except the camera has no zoom	6
although if u wanna camera phone i wouldn't buy this	6
It's touch screen is best i have seen	9
But the main problem is its battery performance	6
1 so u can't install apps in memory card :( !
But for me battery is not a big concern coz i take with me my charger evrywhere i go	6
My recommendation is to buy an extra battery :P that wud really solve ur battery issue	6
there are some battery issues when we use data services	6
feature it will increase battery life	6
I am getting battery life upto 30hrs when data services on 24x7	6
though the screen is small and if you texting using by touching (T9 mode)	9
what i don't like about my phone is the battery performance	5
do buy extra batt:D another disadvantage is the camera cannot zoom although it is 5MP	8
the battery lows down quite fast and i do not use internet	6
lack of battery performance will disturb heavy users	6
lack of battery performance will disturb heavy users	6
Best phone ever but little life battery	6
but the only con it has are the battery life is very low	5
and the camera dosent have zoom before capturing shots	8
nice camera (even if it's simple!)	9
the screen is very responsive	10
The battery since I bought  it I didn't expect too much about	5
The firsts 10 charges the battery lasts nothing	5
!!!
Itz only problem is that it has a low battery life	8
The battery life is not that bad	8
Camera/video quality is amazing(but no zoom)	9
Camera is vry gud n clear though it dont hav zoom feature bt u can download dat frm android market	8
Olover il say battery is litl dissaponting bt 1 must ignore d battery wen u hav so many other features 2 interact with	7
etc etc and speed is never an issue	7
The speed of the phone	7
as does the home screen when going from landscape view to normal	9
The Worst Phone I have ever had in my LIFE !!!The processor is VEry very slow	3
the battery life isn't so good	5
Also the CPU it's laggy	7
Also it have's a 5MP camera	5
I was a bit concerned that this only has a 600Mhz processor	8
I wonder how some of the augmented reality apps would do with a better processor	8
it's actually a very capable phone - with a high-end camera	10
is the battery	1
the phone will eat through around 10% battery life in your pocket when it has only been sat	1
How SE have managed to achieve a self-deflating battery I'll never know	1
its camera result is good	10
the touch screen response is very good	10
Good Camera and Touch Sensitive brilliant	9
Battery life is little poor	6
huge display	9
awesome camera	10
1Ghz processor	8
I have changed SIM card and battery packs: still no solution	4
Battery life is poor: just about makes it through the day	4
I thought I can't put a bigger screen on an Iphone	9
or an 8 megapixels camera with a led flash on the first Galaxy S - But I can upgrade the software on the X10 to make it spedeer	8
The new Timescape widget puts all of your updateds in one place on the home screen	9
the screen is really responsive - Try typing fast to check that	9
If your looking for a big screen the latest Android	9
great camera and a cheap price	8
Other than multimedia options there are no such feature impressed me with big screen display	8
Camera quality	10
Like Battery backup	1
Very happy with display & UI and all other application and phone quality	10
This will the best if they add good music player and enhance the camera option (auto-flash and etc)
I will be more happy if these things overcome in Android 2	5
the screen is just	10
Beautiful Design and a quality camera of 8	9
Quality Camera and HD Recording but only problem is no auto flash	9
Good Camera and Touch Sensitive brilliant	9
Battery life is little poor	9
Battery life is exceptional	9
camera flash	9
very happy with the phone but i'm worried about the screen getting more scratches	7
I play games and surf on web most of the time with my device
strong build except for the screen scratches	7
like the camera	9
1ghz processor	8
Beautiful Design and a quality camera of 8	9
it does not have multi-touch neither Flash support and although the camera is good is a little slow changing perspectives and it does not have flash(camera)	9
beautiful screen	10
excellent camera	10
1ghz processor great for multi tasking	9
internet capabilities and browsing however it is not perfect there are some minor issues 1st it is not running on the latest android but not cares however there is going to be an update coming soon2nd it dosn't have multi touch and this for me is a big blow i think every touch screen phone should now have multi touch3rd if you have small hands it might be quiet uncomfortable to use	10
Making a call where you have to select the number from a narrow strip where the number to dial is displayed is poor	3
The OS out of date and the screen smudges very easily and ruins legibility	3
the camera of course is too great and video like handy cams or may be better	10
battery take about 3 days if you use it in calls only	8
battery life is very good in my opinion	9
the camera was great outdoors (but slow)	8
My only beef is the short battery life when doing a lot surfing and gaming	6
The only real awesome thing about the phone is the camera	10
It has an amazing camera with flash and HD video	10
I love the size and the display	10
It has a fast 1ghz processor	9
You have to get this phone it also has a very long battery life get it	10
1) NO multitouch 2) tremendously low amount of RAM (only 256 mb) 3) 1 ghz processor but horrible speed because of the amount of ram 4) comes with 1	2
Then It stopped displaying new texts	8
Dont forget front camera	7
screen is high pixel for me	10
really speed	10
This phone is amazing! its speeds are amazing and the keyboards are amazing	10
its camera is sooo fascinatiing	10
great battery life for an android smartphone	10
In the price bracket u cant get a 1ghz (samsung ace is 800mhz only) processor aong with a 512 mb and adngroid gingerbread anywhere	10
The touchscreen is fantastic! so are the usual widgets	7
Though ppl may find the 3" screen weird	7
Saves a lotta unnecessary traversing of ur thumb and also ur battery (compared to other smartphones)
the keyboard is PHENOMENAL	5
But ericson needs to illuminate it better!
The phone has actually performed faster than the Arc in many of its tests! the camera is average for a 5mp (compared to the galaxy ace)	7
front camera is decent	7
gallery and music are usual high ericson standards! :) Battery lasts me about 1	5
No smartphone gives u a battery life of more than 22 hrs on heavy usage	5
Display is good	7
and the phone manages excellant browsing speeds! flagship sony ericson	10

Hi everybody!
I'm going to tell you what are my impressions for the phone !
Firstly the processor is very fast thanks to it 1GHz and 512 RAM	9
the screen is very responsive and the proximity sensor and Light sensor are really good	10
The Reality display of the device is very realistic and with beautiful colors	10
The HD recording and picture quality is great and also with realistic colors thanks to Mobile Bravia Engine	10
1 Ghz processor	10
HD Camera	8
Video recording is just excellent but Photo capturing is poor I think	9
Lets talk about Display; I can say the best Display I've ever seen	10
the display is as excellent as phones like Xperia S!
One of other pros is its SD card location	10
you won't need to take the battery out to remove or mount SD card	9
I can't enjoy internet and surf in it easily; the display size isn't big enough and I have trouble with surfing in net	10
Let me give a summary about other things:
Battery is good	9
Battery's awesome too	9
there have great processor with dual core 1Ghz	8
but xperia M have bad camera there	6
if you need some nice camera in the phone Xperia Z1 the best choice	6
3 to camera auto focus bad	10
and quality camera	10
Long battery life	9
the battery lasts for a week between charges (I have to charge my work iPhone 5S at least four times in the same period and they both get the same sort of use)	10
The only real downside is the 5MP camera (the front facing VGA is a joke but I don't tend to use that anyway)	8
I may look to see if I can fit the 8MP camera from my Xperia Ray as that was superb in all conditions	8
display	10
The camera is just great	9
The display doesn’t feel that much ‘live’ as the Samsung displays	10
But Camera is not Best or Worst	8
Xperia M have Average Camera	8
You need Better Camera then choose XPERIA L	8
You need Best Camera then choose XPERIA Z1	8
great phone with dual core krait and adreno 305 no lag and very fast performance
but camera not the best i think and batteray back up bad
memory internal available only 2gb and can't move app to SD card	8
average camera	5
good mid-range phone
battery is awesome
the phone doesn't heat up just little warm up in heavy games that you might never notice	9
Wow bought one factory sealed from expansys for $334 after Google Play took them off the store and the phone is amazing! From the awesome screen to the poly fibre frame and dragontrail glass to the stock pure android experience this is the phablet to buy!	10
I love this big screen! Unlike my T-Mo Galaxy Note II	10
But thanks to the huge keyboard I never make mistakes typing anymore! Though the battery size is slightly smaller than the Galaxy Note II	9
I am getting the same  daily battery life	9
The auto brightness (and overall display quality) is better than the Note II	10
Though the camera has no flash	5
the latest Android upgrade gives the camera HDR which really helps in lower light	5
Great screen	10
Good Battery Life	9
Camera and lack of flash	6
Is a really really good device till date! big and nice 2k display	10
Camera was bad in previous OS but improved after updated to Lollipop	8
it has amazingly nice colours and its a joy to watch movies on it	10
the camera isnt to bad	8
The phone feels of quality and my only negative would be that the protective sheet over the screen is hard to clean from fingerprints and oils	10
but that's compensated for by the behemoth of a screen (which you by now know is completely ridiculous)
Reception: It's reception	9
Camera: This is where sony absolute fails to deliver	3
The camera produces bad to mediocre shots even in perfect light conditions	3
so if you're into a phone for its camera	3
steer away folks
UI speed: The xperia UI looks a bit like stock android with few customizations and is snappy as hell	10

UI speed: The xperia UI looks a bit like stock android with few customizations and is snappy as hell	10
Display: The display of the phone	9
4 inch screen	9
Battery: Not much to be said here	9
except for that I was expecting my gigantic phablet to be sporting more than a average 3k mAh battery when powering the S800 SoC	9
Phone is perfect from screen to procesor	10
battery	10
Camera	7
especially if you value a really large screen	9
the screen stayed blank after calls	10
love the screen	10
love its speed and hardware	10
Negativ: battery time way too short for the fun it's provide (browsing and watching anything is like a small laptop)	9
camera out of date quality (I bet it would have been way too expensive with a better unit) Not so firm case	8
it has amazingly nice colours and its a joy to watch movies on it	10
the camera isnt to bad	7
The phone feels of quality and my only negative would be that the protective sheet over the screen is hard to clean from fingerprints and oils	10
good on screen size	3
camera quality good	8
WORST thing abt it is that the SCREEN and the BACK SIDE GETS SMUDGES VERY EASILY	3
but then the screen kinda stopped changing to landscape mode when I slid the keyboard out	7
The first time I dropped it was on carpet and the camera's protective lens cracked	10
anything that connects to internet is a battery sucker	4
(my fav color) and its good for texting (the whole being a teenager thats a must or my life would b crushed**tears**) yay awsome phone	8
It's much better than a blackberry trackball and since the touchscreen works so well	10
The phone ran slower than molasses and the battery wouldnt stay alive longer than 12 hours with minimal use	1
where as before the update the battery would last upwards of 20 hours with plenty of use	1
battery life does not seem to last long	4
battery life is just fine	4
the life of the battery drains down surprisingly fast	4
The display is excellent	8
bright colors	8
Camera taking quality is horrible due to the phone not having a flash	4
Forget about even using the video camera	4
the phone's RAM and processor are maxed out	5

it really had battery issue	10
Most of the android used to drain the battery as hell	10
i checked by installing battery monitor widget and it hardly exceeds 2mAh	10
the touch screen is good i had the phone less than a year and it works has a lag but it gets my apps	8
I would get the samsung vibrant great phone great amoled display and everything overall this is a good phone	8
My wife has a MyTouch 4G and there are many applications that I cannot download or cannot run because of the slow processor speed	5
The camera is below average (no flash)	4
Now that all these phones with 1Ghz processor came out my phone is accient	5
*Internet: Extremely fast data speeds	9
*Camera: The huge bump located on the back of the phone	10
Crazy camera for a phone this old	10
At 8mp it's still up to parr with the cameras of phones today	10
*UI Speed: Very responsive UI	9
beast camera and powerful	10

*UI Speed: Very responsive UI	9
beast camera and powerful	10
*Display: Really good at the time of purchase	8
dpi is average at around 250 and the display resolution is disappointing for me	8
With phones today having an average of 1280x720 and the Droid DNA with a full HD display (1920x1080wtf) this display is far from the best	8
*Battery: Really	7
This phone does not have adequette battery life	7
I haven't purchased a better battery	7
but i would assume the battery crisis could be resolved	7
This being my first Android or touchscreen phone it is an entirely different experience	10
The quality of the screen is phenomenal	10
The camera is amazing! Takes beautiful sharp pictures	10
gives it a real camera feel	10
Maybe I am just used to long battery life from my BB	6
but the battery in this thing sucks!  After about 10 hours of mild to moderate usage im down to about 20%	6
I have already ordered a 1900mah Anker battery that will hopefully remedy this problem	6
The back of this phone gets pretty hot when you start doing anything processor intensive	9
2Ghz processor starts cranking away	9
Aside from the battery life	6
The hype over the camera is 100% deserved	10
and takes AMAZING pictures for a phone's camera	10
On screen options are fine	10
vibrant display	10
Battery is surprisingly good	8
The phone is very heavy compared to others on the market with no noticeable gain to justify the weight in other areas such as battery life	1
The battery life on this phone is poor and you need to be attentive on what features you have running such as WiFi/4G and turn them off to conserve power	1
In summary the phone has poor power management leading to a short battery life	1
flash and front facing camera was also a huge factor	10
It has the second generation 1ghz processor and can have up to 32 gb of storage	10
It's less expensive than the G2 with all the same capabilities and a little bit of a faster processor	10
I was expecting the internet speeds to be significantly faster than my Samsung Vibrant 3G	8
I didn't notice a difference on the internet speeds	8
The speed of the phone was very fast	10
I love this phone very fast CPU I just update the my touch 4g to Android 2	10
1 battery life is batter with the andorid 2	10
And the camera is great for a phone	10
I noticed the speakers aren't the most powerful and the battery runs out for me at the end of the day ( other smart phones ran till the next) but its all right I really like it	6
I didn't like the other colors (my opinion)	10
but the battery life and the 3G connectivity is poor	3
The battery life is extremely poor	3
It has a really nice display	10
and a amazing camera	10
It's not much of a inside camera	10
Listening to music really drains my battery	3
But it does live up to the "1GHz processor"	10
but the battery life kills it	2
but battery drains to 30%	2
Owned 3 HTC phones and al had the same issue BAD Battery life	2
I see a lot of the reviews on here giving the battery 8/10 or better	2
not sure how they are getting such great battery life	2
but useless if the battery is dead	2
Has the best reception I have had in a tmobile phone and the battery is a issue	10
but still last long for being a 4g phone and the camera is awesome	10
The display is huge good enough between 3	10
3 inch screens and the 4G is fast i get like 5 mb per second in my home	10
Basically this phone can do everything what iphone 3GS can with faster processing speed	10
becuase of speed	10
This is a beautiful phone with a quality build and the color options really give it character	9
The screen display is nice	9
a camera	10
blazing fast download speeds and internet speeds	10
Very good display	10
The only real flaw is the battery	6
Sure the processor is fast	2
Sure the processor is fast	2
The camera worked	5
the phone just isn't very good outside of battery life	9
The phone freezes during every day tasks such as switching from home screen to dialer	7
little things such as occasional 2-3 second delay to return to homescreen or answer/end calls	8
camera quality is decent	7
low res screen	8
for the resolution the screen is nice	8
Battery life is alright but with a lot of apps running all the time it sucks	7
The camera is a 5mp camera with no flash but does have auto focus	7
Has a front facing camera but it's only 0	7
The screen size is average	8
address minus the sim  card and battery which I did	5

An excellent display	9
Weak camera in low light	6
Think before u buy dont get decieved by looks and intel processor	4
Yep the processor is one of the best available in the market	2
But in 6 months the touch screen will start getting damaging and trust me you wont get any service from service centres	2
