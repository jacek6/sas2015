however it feels as if everything but the camera is below premium	8
It felt slow and the battery drain is very annoying	1
Camera is great except in dark but you won't always take pictures at the dark	10
Battery is superb and reliable	10
the display is wonderful very rich in color	10
Higher speed	10
more vibrant screen	10

battery life is really good and it's not too big for my pockets	10
I know lots of people with little hands complain about not being able to hold phones with 5 inch screens	10

the screen is beautiful in displaying colors and anything imaginable	10
no issue with battery life	10
the camera is stunning	10

Display Galaxy S5 Is Pure and without Rival
Overall word : Galaxy S 5 is King Android!	10
Nice vivid screen	10
Camera features are also great	9
Display is fantastic as is the touchwiz UI	10
Web browsing including videos and downloads is speedy even over 3G	9
with the screen surviving more than its fair share of nasty drops completely unscathed as of yet	10
Battery is decent	10
Camera is decent	7
especially the front facing camera which sucks in comparison to the iPhone 5C	7
Battery is excellent with very heavy use(7-9 hours at least) and the new lollipop touchwiz is beautiful	9
This phone has one of the best cameras out there but the selfie camera has problems	9
call and sound quality are very very good and it's a phone you can love only for its excellent and bright super amoled display	10
The Snapdragon 801 processor works without a hitch and no struggle with multitasking	10
1" AMOLED display is big and bright	10
The camera has stellar quality	10
The battery life seems to be on the good side	9
battery drain	7
Oversaturated screen	7
The screen is very good	10

The camera is really good	9
the only weakness is low light photos	9
I don't recommend this phone to anybody in fact i recommend people to shop for something else instead this phone dies fast always stop responding and acts up if you try to put a lock screen on it will always call 911 for you	10
Outer screen is fine	7
speedtest	10
net/my-result/a/1237478844 I challenge ANY phone show me the speed	10
It runs very fast and smooth despite Touchwiz and although the camera quality is quite frustrating indoors	8
After 7 months of use screen hasn't scratched much but the cheap plastic edges have started to chip and scratch which is a shame	10
Battery life isn't fantastic but it's manageable	8
For me when spending most of my time in an area with poor reception I find that it impacts the battery time very negatively	8
Just look at the s5's camera	10
Or maybe the display	10
Or even the speed of it	10
The camera is just superb with its amazing blur background function	10
the battery is great last one day in constant usage	10
the full HD screen is excellent	10
the screen is clear	10
the battery last	10
but s5 best phone in world

Display	9
multiple window and back buttons are not part of screen	9
The screen is beautiful	10
the camera is amazing	10

I dropped my phone in water and it got damaged somehow	10
Its camera is incredible (16 megapixels) as well as its in camera settings	10
big screen is live and bright	10
UI work perfectly ans speed is good	9
Other features that I love about it are (keep in mind I'm comparing it to the phone I used to own before the S5): longer battery life	10
brighter screen when under the sun	10
amazing camera quality	10
faster phone and internet performance and that little notification light on the top of the screen	10
The phone's high-quality camera won't let you down	10
and the display is bright and beautiful	10
I was very unimpressed with its camera	9
I actually have grown to like the one handed use feature which shrinks the screen to what ever side your tub is on	10
The camera is fantastic	9
I had an 8 mp camera on my last phone and this is truly better	9
Plus many of the features on the camera are fun and very useful	9
In deciding which phone to choose the camera was one of the most important to me and I am happy with the performance of this one	9
I'm finding the battery life is excellent	10

Watching Netflix for over an hour and a half lost me about 5 percent of my battery	10
for the camera and the design	10
Camera very good	10
Battery life very good	9
Display quality exelent	10
Front camera quality not bad	10
that am pretty much impressed by the Display	10
Screensize	10
Camera	10
battery backup and water proofness of the device	10
Main reason why I switched from the iPhone 5S is because the battery burned and eventually ended up dying on me	10
So I decided that I am tired of Apple's poor battery life and decided to try out the Galaxy	10
(lollipop being the last straw) the phone became very slow and the battery would get hot and die quickly	7

I use it as my lockscreen as now no need to remember those long pins or passwords	9

Talking about the camera	9
it is a good camera	9
Being a photographer	9
and upon using the flash the photos come out with a blueish tint	9
a good all round point & shoot camera	9
Battery life is also good as I manage a complete day on a full charge	8
The size feels great I am coming from a note 3 and was a little concerned that i would miss that screen size but i actually like this better	10
The display is honestly the best I've seen in a phone before and all the features are pretty amazing as well	10
The build quality of Samsung phones is really strange and has always insisted on making phones with plastic casing! 
With the introduction of the fingerprint hacking advised not to use the camera in 4k mode and not try its waterproof properties	6

I dont notice a huge difference in the camera quality other than the upgraded HDR mode and the 4k video mode	10
5 Ghz quad-core processor	9
I love the screen	10
the camera	10
and grippy in the hand
 -Screen is unbelievable
 -Used it while walking for 20 minutes in the rain	10
-Android is extremely refreshing and fun after using IOS for the past 6 months (my opinion)
 -The biggest pro of all is the swappable battery	10
you're probably going to put a case on it anyway and when the battery is shot after a year who cares how it looks?
 -The "Smart Remote" is amazing and incredibly useful
 -Ultra-power saving mode works very well	10
and the battery only went down by 10%
 -The one-handed operation mode is pretty handy	10
It can be enabled by simply swiping the screen in a certain way	10

The functionality of the removable battery far outweighs any "premium design" advantage the HTC One and iphone may have in my opinion	10
I also wonder why reviewers love the HTC One's design so much when the massive bottom bezel (and on-screen buttons) take up a quarter of the potential screen real estate	10
Smoothness and cameras are prime features	10
And don't get me started on the battery which is amazing	10
only reason it didn't get a ten is because I'm comparing the battery to the note 3	9
I like everything about this phone! The camera is excellent	10
Strong camera and the silicon have the edge here	9
screen's over saturation is eye popping but unnatural	3
I highly recommend this phone to anyone new to the smart phone world! Beautiful screen display	10
the screen is indisputably beautiful with full HD recording and playback capabilities	10
the battery life is above average under normal usage it gets me through the day without charging it and on 3g	9
One of the best Samsung phones! Removable battery	10
Super AMOLED Display	10
Unfortunately the screen has crashed on the first month of use	9
The camera takes good photos in strong light	7
I am very upset with the lag user interface and the poor life of the battery	5
Great phone for a geek and a person who wants to play with his phone 24/7 but bad phone for average user cause UI is hard to learn and people who dont care about those air sensors are gonna hate it 
+
this can be named a camera phone	10
The camera is just brilliant and the fact that the phone can do so much more is just enough to spin my world around	9
the display is just stunning	9
the camera also got plenty of features but auto mode does cover all	9
and the battery is also okay	8
but after seeing its camera	10
3 update kind of screwed the battery life	9
Nice specs and display	9
The camera is very nice but not in low light scenarios	9
camera	10
of course with the camera features
great job samsung	10
when I was getting it immediately noticed the difference I'm screen quality and I wanted more	10
even the battery	10
The screen is amazing	10
the camera is great and the sound adapts to your ear	9
The battery and my 64GB SD card are swapable	9
the camera sticks out	9
One the most powerful Android phone packed with great screen	10
13MP camera and completely new features	10
2 is great and the phone has great camera with great features	10
good battery life and no reception weakness	9
The display is big enough to produce quality images and very crispy and normal to human eyes	10
Touch screen is ultra-sensitive as it even response to the fingers with gloves	10
Removable battery and expandable micro SD card	9
the water's fine! lag? what lag??? overheating??? what overheating??? bad battery life? really	9
Well the phone itself does not have that premium feel but packs a killer processor and stunning features that would sure be useful for everyday usage	10
this is because it has a superb display	10
never been this easy to use a 5" display and much more	10
but people who read the review lyk i did lots of time wanna knw the bad aspects more ( well thats what i looked for alwayz) and so here's the probs i face:
-The battery life sucks	6
5 days because where ever i read reviews they say it has a gud battery life	6

Just the right size in terms of build and screen	10
I prefer hardware keys as opposed to on screen	10
gives you a bigger screen and a few extra options on how to interact	10
Basically unless you need a phone without  a removable battery	10
the speed	10
the features and the screen!!!	10
Its screen is one of the best displays out there with very good color rendering	10
The 13MP camera is noteworthy	10
Amazing display	10
fantastic camera	10
The good things the S4 has over the S3: a brighter crisper display with more natural colors (the +0	10
better camera	10
better battery life and that would be it	9
I think there is a improvedment on its battery life	8
on standby mode the temperature of the battery was 36 *C but with in 4mins using the date connect and playing temple run 2	8
the camera mode	9
It cant using moving the home screen to next  screen	8
and camera its great	9

Im so happy using the camera mode but one thing is i dont like is Its Too hard to use all the mode for a biginer like me espcially the best photos and the drama shot	9
(GT-I9500)
This phone is phenomenal!
The display is gorgeous	10
The Camera quality is absolutely beautiful!
The Camera app is very cool with all the new features	10
the camera is extremely good but the device does lag	10
the battery is great	10
Camera features are unbelievably amazing and unique	10
and the screen pops colors right to my eyes with crystal clear images	10
Processor has shown no lag	10
the camera is just awsome so much powerfull featurs just great	10
The only problem is the battery life	1
screen brightness lowest possible and wi-fi on almost 24/7	10
I even bought a new battery	1
i have samsung galaxy s4 i9500 black gold edition overall all its a good mobile only the problem is battery	6
its battery timing enough its just gives me 2 to 3 hour of usage and 10 to 12 hour without use	6
Calls don't seem to draing the battery	4
I use it everyday and it works just as great as the day I bought it!  I'm a little rough with the phone too as I've cracked the screen twice when I dropped it on pavement	10
Both cameras take great quality pictures	10
My husband has the same phone and neither of us ever had 1 problem with it!  The only issue I had is I broke the screen and it was expensive to fix (I called around to several places and came to the realization it's just an expensive fix)	10
I was happy with it but unfortunately I borke it's display	10
i recommend it to everyone wants a hi-end phone with a slim body and a good screen size	10
I have it for almost 2 years now and so far so good
The camera is just perfect and quality is perfect	10
Nice specs and display	10
The camera is just excellent	10
First I was having a problem with the battery on jellybean 4	7
and the battery may be a bit of power	8
Battery life for me is good	8
The phone played games well and the camera was good	10
Replaceable battery	10
and 1080p Super Amoled Screen	10
The camera was really sharp	10
The phone had some cool non-gimmick features like 2 apps on the screen at once waving your hand over the screen while its locked to see the time	10
the iphone has a battery that sucks	6
The display colors	10
Recently woke up last morning to find my phones screen unglued! This last drop inspired me to write a review for people who might foolishly think that this phone is worth its price	10
I have purchase Samsung S4 on 28-Dec-13 After regular user on 14-MAR-1 my screen display was not working suddenly So I went to Care Centre  Their representative told me it is physical damaged as one small crack was there on left hand corner side	2
I told him it is not dropped nor any pressure I have applied  Then he asked me where you carry your mobile then he told me due to carrying mobile in jeans pocket it may damaged your screen display	2
I like all but not have display contrast like note 2	6
am avut 1 an note 2 nu am nimic de zis rau de el am vrut ceva mai mic si am luat s4 prima dezamagire a fost displayul care are culori foarte fade ca la un lcd nu amoled cu marimea mam obisnuit	6
Everything from the processing power to the display is/was amazing	10
Even the battery life lasted me about 14 hours of strenuous use throughout the day	8
the battery lasts about 1/3 of the time it did with 4	8
The glass was fine but the screen underneath broke and no longer displays anything	10
perfect camera	10
perfect screen	10
highly resolution display	10
Reliable as well as great battery life	10
Is excellent in overall a little weak on the battery though highly built has cool new features is preaty fast I encourage every one to try samsungs flagship has cool tricks like gestures	9
I'm completely satisfied with this phone and I won't change Galaxy S4 to another phone even after 5 years! After 4 month of not very carefull use there are no scratches on the screen and few little scratches on back case because it is made from a thin plastic	10
Camera is quite well but if the light is poor	8
UI speed is fast but sometimes if there are many applications opened the phone may slow down and restart but it happens once a month or rarer	9
Visibility in sunlight is good because the phone changes brightness of screen depending on outside light	10
The battery lasts between 16-20 hours in power saving regime but anyway you need to charge it every day	8
The display colors	10
There is bug in google locations services which sucks your battery dry in no time	8
It is somewhat vulnerable because the screen broke already from a fall from a couch	10
9 GHz quad-core processor and 2 GB of RAM	9
A 13 MP camera that has lots of features such as eraser	9
I broke the first screen when it fell out of my pocket	6
Amazing display	10
fantastic camera	10
Its screen is one of the best displays out there with very good color rendering	10
The 13MP camera is awesome	10
The only issue i have with this phone is the Battery life	6
Smart screen)	10
something that you probably have never done before like swapping pictures by simply waving your hand without touching the screen's phone	10
a beautiful display	10
a great camera quality	9
a smooth screen transition	10
create memories through photos that have been captured	9
you can not screenshot your screen easily by hand swipe through palm motion from Motion	10

they screenshots easily by just a gentle hand swiping	10
you can still screenshot in an ease way by pressing the home and power button simultaneously	10
It really flies and the display is beautiful	10
while I wanted a bigger display on my phone	10
my finger also presses the screen making it do two actions at once	10
why didn't they just make it capacitive like the others or onscreen buttons? Overall	10
Battery life bested other top models like xperia z and htc one	9
Camera takes sharp photos outdoor	9
thats my opinion about the phone to be honest the phone is just great i cant say anything about it i understands what the user want and it dose it perfect i really like it battery life is really good 9	10
8 out of 10display is perfect 10 out of 10	10
recption is excellent and photos are excellent	10
And the camera shutter cannot be muted unless you mute the phone	10
I thought that I would have a hard time adapting to the significantly larger screen	10
in part thanks to the gorgeous 1080p display	10
the first thing that got my attention was the beautifull screen and it still amazes my every day !! There has been alot of critism about the design of the Galaxy S4	10
camera is good but not good in night or dim light	5
battery drains too fast	2
Awesome! The phone will lag between screens sometime even with Quad core 1900	10
The camera is probably the best camera so far and takes brilliant	10
sharp photos	10
from having the latest android to having a removable battery and back cover for an up-gradable SD card	10
The screen is no doubt the most beautiful display on the market	10
Suggest to prepare a spare battery	8
Onite 2600mAh battery on Amazon for Samsung Galaxy S4--$9	8
98
Onite 5200mAh extended battery for S4--only $19	8
camera is fantabulous	10
battery tiiming is great	10
The camera was also a big player in my decision	10
the 13mp camera really shines and takes good quality pics in a variety of conditions	10
There are also more camera options on the S4	10
Especially in a decent case with a screen protector	10
its blazzing fast processor	10
very nice camera	10
I really like the improvements to the camera	9
mail and messaging apps and the screen is Amazing	10
I do not like using extra protective accessories like cover or pouch or even screen protector and when you use the phone naked like I do it is better to be plastic or policarbonish something	10
I just bought this phone for T-Mobile and I got to say that this is a awesome smartphone and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a phone with a big display	10
a awesome camera	10
replaceable battery	10
the Camera takes crisp Photos and Video	10
I wish the screen got brighter during the day but ti goes low enough at night for ease of viewing	10
And you have much photo editing choices	10
The front color is real black	10
replaceable battery	8
Smart screen)	10
something that you probably have never done before like swapping pictures by simply waving your hand without touching the screen's phone	10
The SuperAMOLED FHD is just awesome! I've compared it( on Adobe RGB mode) to the Retina display of the iPhone5	10
which is the reference in term of natural colour reproduction and my conclusion was; YES FINALLY an amoled panel that's able reproduce natural colours while retaining the advantages of a classic AMOLED display	10
The camera is actually one of the best	10
8gb of storage isn't enough to install lots of apps but it has a Microsd card slot for storaging media not apps and it's  has a low resolution display of 540x960 but it's not bad at all	8
I can't believe this is faster than my Galaxy S3 in terms of UI speed	10
Battery gives me more than a full day (24 hours	10
3 inch screen	10
Battery life is also good	10
Only minor con the screen res	9
Well I dropped this about a foot of the ground and the screen completely broke and I couldn't even use it any more	9
and it wastes some of its screen to the three function keys	10
whereas with this phone you get all screen and no waste of space (buttons at the bottom which are always there)	10
and the battery life is on par with all other phones in my experience	10
The screen is unbearably small and the resolution is horrible	1
Build quality is what I would expect for a Samsung device with removable battery and SD card	7
games load fine and the screen quality is good but could have put 720p resolution	8
The only thing I can criticize is the battery	6
has a large enough display	9
i think great phone and battery backup well	10
Camera is very good	10
The battery was bad too as it drained within a day and its supposed to have a very long battery life	5
it takes amazing underwater photo's and video's	7
That's very disappointing because I'm waiting on a update that will improve the battery	5
This one is easy to root - that's one thing I love about it and it has a high speed	10
I had a Samsung rugby sport that was built very well and had good battery life	2
The back battery cover broke the first time I took it off to insert my sim card	2
So now my phone is constantly warning me to check the battery cover and charge port door	2
The battery life is horrible	2
The screen looks great and can be used with gloves	9
Great phone and lookes good in all three colors	9
It's display is so sharp and clear	10
Aqua mode is an awesome camera addition	10
the only problem i found was that the battery is draining really fast	7
bt if there would be a expandable battery i would go for it other wise the phone is a beast :-)	7
Almost double the processor	10
Both I and my daughter in law have the S4 Zoom & we LOVE it! If you always wished you could carry your good quality camera around with you	9
Great for people who love to take good photos	9
I would like to have a bigger screen size & more pixels	8
It's not the best compact zoom camera	9
Sorry for my english but i am from Mexico

I liked galaxy zoom alot! Its a great phone with good caracteristics and the camera is excellent! You have to think that it can be compared with the nokia 1020 but in price it is better	10
I also liked that it is compatible with 4G and the internet speed is excellent	10
This is a phenomenal camera and could be a greater phone if Samsung put it on a regular S4 "chassis" if you will	10
My hands are large and I struggle with holding on to it!  It's a hot camera and I enjoy taking pics of my family but I also need a phone that won't die out on me before the end of the day	10
I personally think that S4 Zoom is versatile as for taking pictures with only a press of a button whether it's from the screen or from the built in button at the side of the phone	9
With a great feature of 10x Optical zoom and still retains the crisp of the taken photo at any distance	10
sufficient battery life	9
very good camera	9
fast processors	10
Pros: Awesome battery life	10
Cons: camera quality does not measure up to Samsung flagships	8
no split screen capabilities	9
the battery life	9
the camera	10
i have the Gold color one and it's very sexy	8
the only problem with my Xperia Z5 Dual is the Processor i guess? Snapdragon 810 ver2	9
the battery temp could reach up to 40°C	2
Only have a poor back camera	7
Display is great	10
Front camera is nice	7
but back camera can be better from Sony for mid range phone	7
